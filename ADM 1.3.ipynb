United by this promise, the possessed members of the Souma family shall always return to each other under any circumstances. Yet, when these bonds shackle them from freedom, it becomes an undesirable burden—a curse. As head of the clan, Akito is convinced that he shares a special connection with the other Soumas. While he desperately clings to this fantasy, the rest of the family remains isolated and suppressed by the fear of punishment. Tooru Honda, who has grown attached to the Soumas, is determined to break the chains that bind them. Her companionship with the family and her friends encourages her to move forward with lifting the curse. However, due to confounding revelations, she struggles to find the tenacity to continue her endeavors. With time slowly withering away, Tooru contends with an uncertain future in hopes of reaching the tranquility that may lie beyond all this commotion.

United by this promise, the possessed members of the Souma family shall always return to each other under any circumstances. Yet, when these bonds shackle them from freedom, it becomes an undesirable burden—a curse. As head of the clan, Akito is convinced that he shares a special connection with the other Soumas. While he desperately clings to this fantasy, the rest of the family remains isolated and suppressed by the fear of punishment.\n",

Her companionship with the family and her friends encourages her to move forward with lifting the curse. However, due to confounding revelations, she struggles to find the tenacity to continue her endeavors. With time slowly withering away, Tooru contends with an uncertain future in hopes of reaching the tranquility that may lie beyond all this commotion.\n",

Love, grief, letting go of the past and becoming your own person, etc. The overarching narrative spanning 60+ episodes of breaking familial bonds and moving on from trauma was so beautifully done that here at the end of that journey, I’m left in tears. For me, the mark of a true masterpiece is something that teaches me valuable life lessons. I lost my father to cancer at 15. I turned to animanga and light novels and have found many important things since then. The one thing that I still struggle with is letting go of the past. This remake arrived at the perfect time for me, and I could not be happier with the story-telling, character depth and educational aspects of this series.\n",

      "                It wouldn’t be a Furuba review if we didn’t talk about love. Love is at the core of Furuba’s story. Familial, platanoic and romantic. Over 3 amazing seasons, we are introduced to a variety of characters who are in one way or another dealing with some complications of love. Whether it’s an ex, parent who can’t remember their kid, abusive parents, etc. The story does an amazing job of building nuanced and realistic relationships between characters. This applies to both the romantic sort and non romantic sort. Obviously, there are some exaggerations and anime-y logic going on with some of the relationship building, but for the most part, the relationships in Furuba feel organic and realistic. The romantic ships are built up over the course of over 60 episodes and are done in such a way where you can’t have been oblivious to them forming, but they’re also not too in your face, at least until the second half of this season. In this season, it felt like everything was turned up to the max. The tension, stakes and action were amazing in Furuba Final. I would say that if you found S1 and S2 good, you’ll be blown away by the jump in quality we got this time around. Fruits Basket has always felt a little soapy, but this season felt like a straight up Mexican Telenovela. And I loved every minute of it.\n",

You know you’ve done something right as an author when people have side characters as their favourite characters. Looking back on where everyone started in episode 1 back in 2019, and where they’ve ended up here in the final season is truly beautiful. It’s a great opportunity to reflect on how we, as an audience, have grown along with this cast we love so much.\n",

Most of the plot in Fruits Basket comes from Tohru's encounters with the cursed Souma family members. As you guess, these members have shitty lives and backstories because of their curse, so they need a little bit of rehabilitation, and that's Tohru's duty in this series. She gives love, company, friendship, and a helping hand to most of the Chinese Zodiac members and literally saves them. The main characters like Kyo and Yuki have several differents episodes in the different seasons, but the \"saving\" of the supporting cast ─Tohru's two best friends are also in this category along with the Souma family members─ mostly happens in their respective arcs, except for the conclusion parts, almost all of the conclusions happen in the final season. And these drama-heavy arcs are the strongest parts of the Fruits Basket along with the conclusion parts.\n",

      "                Fruits Basket actually starts as your typical shoujo-romance anime with a little bit of reverse harem teasing. But, this reverse harem teasing never happens again after episode 6, and the show starts to give you drama-heavy arcs while keeping its romcom core as good as ever. It handles different themes like bad parenting, love, friendship, admiration, forgiveness, and many more with its characters in these arcs, and never fails to tell its stories to the viewer in the best way possible. The directing is top-notch. It isn't anything flashy like you can see that so-called big names' works, but it manages to convey many different emotions to you. TMS and Yoshihide Ibata put so much soul into these new Fruits Basket adaptations and created a lot of unforgettable emotional scenes.\n",

      "                I said none of the characters overstays their welcome, but I also think some of them used way less than their actual potential. For this part, we can separate the characters of Fruits Basket into three categories: main, supporting+, and supporting-. As you can guess, the main characters are the ones that have the most screen time. Supporting+ characters are the ones that have a lot of impact in the story but don't have as much screen time as the main characters. And the supporting- characters are the ones you will see rarely in the series except for their own arcs.\n",

      "                One of the Fruits Basket's biggest cons and pros come from the supporting- characters. They are great additions, but none of them used till their last potential, especially Ritsu. However, if the author decided to use them as much as the supporting+ characters, this series would need another two-cour season and the episode count would be over 85. In this case, the series itself would overstay its welcome. Some may say the author threw so many unnecessary characters and didn't use them, but I don't think so. Like I said before, their additions to the story are great and somehow necessary for the main cast's character development. It's a dilemma, and the answer is up to you. Do you prefer more episodes with more character arcs even though it will overstay its welcome, or do you prefer fewer episodes even though that means some characters won't get as much deepness as the other characters? Personally, I prefer the latter one.\n",

Watching Kyo and Yuki's growth throughout the series, and seeing Tohru's cheerful smile that fills me with happiness in almost every episode are the memories I won't forget easily. Also, the romance between the main couple is probably my favorite romance in any show right after the romance of Clannad's main couple. Their love is growing naturally and realistically. When the show reveals who loves who you don't get surprised. And they don't become a couple easily, they fight for it. I wish I could talk about the main couple's romance longer, but since this review covers all three seasons, it's almost impossible for me without spoiling anything, and I don't want to give a spoiler in this review. So, let's move to the production qualities.\n",

Where the Fruits Basket really shines is coloring and special effects. There are so many scenes you can get a screenshot and use as a wallpaper without adding any filters thanks to the amazing coloring, and every single of important scenes have them. However, you won't see the special effects that much since they are mostly used in the shapeshifting scenes and the amount of them aren't much. On the other hand, the sound quality is perfect in every aspect. The voice actings are amazing as you expect from a cast like this, and the soundtracks are incredible. Fruits Basket has the same guy who composed the OST of Your Lie in April as the composer, and he did an amazing job in this series too.\n",

When news about a remake of this beloved Shoujo series got around, a large portion of the anime community was understandably thrilled. Having zero knowledge about the series, I was definitely curious what the fuss was about and decided to venture into the world of Fruits Basket. What I found was a\n",

      "                world so beautifully crafted, with an interesting premise and many promising characters. Even though this is the case, slowly but surely I started to lose interest in the series due to its initial formulaic setup, whereby nearly every episode acts as a character introduction for a new Zodiac member. And with things becoming hectic in real life, I ended up forgetting about the series and stopped midway through the first season. That was roughly 2 years ago. Recently, I realised that the Final Season is topping the MAL charts and I thought to myself, “Wow, is the show really that good?”. Once again, my interest in the series piqued and I finally decided to set time aside to finish watching the series. And indeed, it really was that good. Slice of life as a genre has always been my personal favourite, with series like Kaguya-sama Love is War and Clannad AS being in my Top 3. And now I can confidently say, Fruits Basket is one of the greats in the genre.\n",

      "                What sets the series aside from other shows, is the amount of effort and care dedicated into crafting characters and building character relationships. We are introduced to the many Soma members early on, with the first half of the first season essentially used to introduce us to a wide range of characters. Each episode we watch as Tohru in one way or another form a personal connection with the members of the Soma family, which becomes the backbone of the series. As stand alone episodes, the quality was undoubtedly there, but what it lacked was a clear direction of where the series is headed. However, this was no doubt purposefully done to allow us as the audience to have an emotional connection with the big cast of characters early on. Some of the characters that I found most interesting are as follows - Kyou, Tohru, Yuki, Akito, Saki and Shigure, but I’ll be focusing on the main trio and their journey throughout the series.\n",

      "                Let’s begin with our main heroine, Tohru Honda. Acting as the heart of the story, she represents the ray of sunshine that descends upon the Soma family. Her righteous personality can be so entrancing at times, that it may seem that she has no flaws. She was initially portrayed as a flat, one-trait character, in fact the majority of the cast is. But do not be deceived, for she is in fact one of the best written characters in the show, and is deserving of the title of main heroine. In the Final Season, the layers of facades were peeled back and we are introduced to the real Tohru, a girl with her own sets of insecurities. With the passing of her beloved mom, she was unable to move on. While she deceives herself and those around her, saying that everything is fine and putting up a smile, deep down she is continuously burdened by the trauma. In the memory of her late mother, she swore to always put her mom first in her heart. This sentiment that she has for her mom may seem lovely at first, but it ends up being an unhealthy coping mechanism, with Tohru being over reliant on her late mother. Watching her develop and mature as a person in the Final season is a really heartwarming sight. Now with Kyou being the No.1 in her heart, it doesn’t mean that she doesn’t love her mom. The love between her and her mother is unbreakable, and that is a fact that will forever be unchanged. Her mom wants her to find happiness even in her absence, and that’s what Tohru will do. To see the people that she helped along the way return the favour, and guide her to overcome this barrier that she imposed upon herself, I can’t help but be genuinely touched by the show. It is a perfect portrayal of what goes around, comes around. While not perfect, Tohru shows how far kindness can go, and how even the little things can rub off on someone and change them for the better.\n",

      "                Moving on, when we were first introduced to Yuki, he was renowned in the school for being the Prince due to his elegant looking face. Nothing could be further away from the truth. Being tormented by Akito since young, Yuki was an empty shell. Withdrawn from the people around him, lacking the courage to stand up for himself and unable to bring himself out of the darkness, Yuki was in a very pitiful and depressing state initially. And then comes Tohru, the ray of sunshine. Her entrancing personality was able to show Yuki the possibility, that just maybe, he too is able to love himself. I remember there was this one scene of Yuki in Season 1 episode 18 that really stuck with me.\n",

      "                Yuki: “Learn to love yourself?” What does that mean? How are we supposed to find something good about ourselves? The whole reason why we hate ourselves is because we can only see the parts we hate. So forcing ourselves to find “good points” feels hollow, like we’re making things up. It’s not like that. That’s not how it works. I think it’s only when someone says they love you that you’re able to start loving yourself.”\n",

      "                It is true that we are the only ones capable of helping ourselves, but sometimes, to even find the courage, the motivation to do so may seem to be a nigh impossible task. Others shouldn't be directly providing everything for the individual, instead what others are capable of doing is providing the environment, providing the platform for him/her to once again take courage and rise up. I find this to be a satisfying conclusion for Yuki’s character to come to, and is in fact quite wise of him. Yuki’s character growth throughout the Final season was just amazing to watch. Being able to look forward by overcoming his past ordeals, stepping out of his comfort zone when he joined the student councils, are amazing feats considering the short time span for all these events to occur.\n",

      "                Lastly, my personal favourite character of the series - Kyou. While the moments shared between Tohru and Yuki were very heartfelt, the moments between Tohru and Kyou were just on another level. From the very first season, it was already hinted quite explicitly that these two are essentially destined for each other. With Tohru’s favourite animal being the cat, and Kyou being the one ostracised from the rest of the Soma family, it only fits for the story to put these two together. That said, I do feel for people that believed that Yuki and Tohru should have gotten together, because the story often portrays a sort of rivalry happening between Kyou and Yuki as they fight over Tohru. But alas, it is ultimately revealed that Yuki sees her as a Mother like figure, essentially mother zoning her, which I find to be relatively hilarious. Thankfully, the story also gave Yuki a happy ending, with him finding love in Machi, creating a believable and cute chemistry between the two.\n",

      "                AHEM, back to Kyou. As a standalone character, Kyou’s character journey is an art form. Being born with the ‘accursed’ cat spirit, people are unable to distinguish Kyou as a person from the spirit, causing him to receive a heavy amount of hatred and spite. All of the Zodiac members suffer the same fate, but it is especially so for Kyou. With his mom committing suicide, it scarred Kyou emotionally and mentally, as the people around him force him to acknowledge that it is HIS fault for the suffering of those around him. The tragic circumstances as a kid caused him to develop 2 major traits. The 1st of which being self hatred, thinking that he is not deserving of any form of love. The 2nd being an unhealthy coping mechanism, in the form of burdening Yuki with his hatred, deeming him the one that caused all his misfortune.\n",

      "                Time and time again, he was met with situations where he inevitably hurt those around him due to circumstances he can't control. Even the toughest of will would have a hard time going through what he went through, which is why it is completely understandable for him to harbor such a deep rooted hatred for himself. However, that is not the narrative being told through Kyou. While it is easy to wallow in sorrow, to cry and loathe your own unfortunate circumstances, is it really going to change anything? Sure, it is understandable and even acceptable for us to blame tragic situations for how we turned out to be, but doing so we are ultimately unable to confront our demons and move on. The important aspect of Kyou’s journey is coming to acceptance of his own tragic past, acknowledging that while he may have a part to play in causing the suffering of others, he ultimately shouldn’t constraint himself to the past, that he should learn to forgive himself. Sometimes, the simplest solution is often the hardest. By no means is moving on an easy task, the many characters in Fruits Basket have proven that throughout the span of 63 episodes. Even so, we should not be afraid and limit ourselves to our own tragedy, after all there is no harm in trying to move on and live our lives to the fullest.\n",

      "                Kyou’s unhealthy coping mechanism was also ultimately resolved in the Final Season. Deep down he always knew and understood that his way of coping wasn’t good for him in the long run. In spite of the fact that he knew that Yuki wasn’t the cause of his misery, he continued to put him on a villainous pedestal, because it is easier that way. To know and understand something is different from accepting it. Kyou was initially unable to accept the fact that he was wrong, that Yuki isn’t the villain that he makes out to be. However, he got a wake up call in Tohru, the girl he has an unyielding love for. He was ultimately able to accept it, able to move on, and able to live his life to the fullest. It is interesting to note that Kyou's and Tohru's character arcs are not so dissimilar. Both had the same issues of having a bad way to cope with past traumas, and both managed to overcome them in the end. Kyou’s character journey in this series is no doubt my favourite, given the depth of his character and the amount of dedication and passion put into writing his arc.\n",

      "                But of course, characters can only be portrayed properly with proper visuals. Animated by TMS entertainment, the visuals are just stunning. While there may not be any jaw dropping Sakuga moments, the frames in this show are just inherently pleasing to look at. It is hard to find a single frame where the characters are off model, or the background looks bland. The beautiful visuals bring life to the wonderful characters of Fruits Basket, and I am so glad it got such a premium treatment. Throughout the series you can feel the effort the animators from TMS entertainment put into animating Fruits Basket, and I have to say their hard work definitely paid off. And to no one's surprise, the beautiful visuals are accompanied by equally beautiful music. The OSTs in Fruits Basket really reminded me of the melodic tunes from Clannad. If I have to choose, my personal favourite would probably be ‘I will protect you’ and ‘Spring will come when the snow melts away’, with them playing in a lot of the significant moments of the show, sending goosebumps throughout my body and tears to flow out. The Opening is also incredible. On top of the amazing shots of the characters in the background, the banger song ‘Pleasure’ really suits the vibe of the series. Not to forget the amazing voice actors that gave it their best to give us the most authentic experience this anime can give. There were moments where the characters shined through the collective efforts of the voice actors, going above and beyond to deliver their lines. The production value in this show is just crazy.\n",

      "                With the amazing production values aside, I do have some critics for the show. For starters, there are many scenes that involve showing the tragic past of the characters, which may be a bit overused for some people. For example, we are given multiple iterations of Yuki’s traumatic time with Akito. While it hammers home the point of Yuki being continuously tied to the past, this way of showing it may instead turn the audience off, given that they have already seen essentially the same scenes several times. This can also be seen as a way of over dramatising the characters’ inner turmoil which in turn gives the opposite effect of undermining the problem the characters face. That said, I personally did not have much of a problem with it myself, but it is something I undoubtedly noticed. Furthermore, due to the nature of the story, some of the characters are not fully realised. For example, we barely got any screen time of Souma Ritsu, the person that represents the Monkey, only seeing his character growth in one episode in Season 1. Given his importance as one of the Zodiac members, I thought it was a shame that he didn’t play a bigger role in the story. That said, I rather them focus on the main trio instead of giving these characters with minor roles to play more screen time, so I guess it was a fair trade off. Nonetheless, my point still stands that some of the characters introduced have wasted potential and could have been utilised far more efficiently.\n",

      "                Overall, Fruits Basket was a really wonderful ride, and the Final season was amazing. It's unapologetically genuine characters were a breath of fresh air in the current pool of anime shows. While Akito has always been a thorn in this beautiful story, even she can change. The idea of Fruits Basket is that we should never be tied down by unhealthy restrictive bonds, and instead choose a path to take for ourselves. Whether it is school, your job or your love life, you are free to choose as long as you don’t harm others along the way. It was a surreal experience and I am so glad that I sat through it all :)\n",

And for the past 2 years (since Spring 2019) signalling the start of the complete re-adaptation of the classic Chinese Zodiac spirit story and plot, mangaka and overall series supervisor Natsuki Takaya has finally fulfilled her dream with the help of her production team at TMS and 8Pan...albeit with one serious problem that it has to negate to make the experience a great one.\n",

      "                Shoujo manga in recent memory, I will not try to play bootlick with you and state the \"5 formula aspects\" that everyone does, especially in sequel shows where most, of not all characters reprise their roles with the same effects and such. Only new ones are accepted that's exclusive to the aforementioned sequel, and I don't care about overstating the same things as per prior seasons before it, so it's best that I keep it short.\n",

      "                The ultimatum of Fruits Basket: The Final, much so of just completing the entire adaptation of the manga, is pacing the sequence of events in a way that does not feel jarring, yet feeling natural. Seeing as though the Final season (a.k.a Season 3) is only 13 episodes long, with all the various chapter adaptations done before in the prior 2 seasons, the only thing I was worried about are the chapter adaptations due to time constraints and the stuffing of the many left unadapted chapters that the first 2 seasons have set up incredibly well due to them being continuous 2-cours. By definition, a longer production schedule meant that the production team can take the adapted material slowly and padding it at a steady pace. Season 3, or The Final however, has like the final stretch of some 30-40 chapters (including the chapters that are split-adapted) to go, and that worries me a lot if we are able to be like mangaka Natsuki Takaya, to come out of Fruits Basket fully satisfied with the results. As much as they tried to cramp as much of the reminder as they can (and subsequently go anime-original with the re-arranging of manga chapters), it honestly still feels like a bit of Season 2 with tonal changes, only being more abrupt this time since time is the sole limiting factor here. Nonetheless, all the kinks are sorted out with the FruBa community getting a lot more toxic than before, I'd say that Fruits Basket is the new legend that has achieved how it is done in the modern age of adaptations, that it should've been the gold standard back then with loose adaptations and simpler artwork of the 2000s (that isn't so much nice to watch anymore, except for nostalgia reasons).\n",

      "                Another ultimatum is the obvious continuation to closure of the Chinese Zodiac story and plot of the Soma Family. The 4 central leads: cat Kyo, outsider Tohru, rat Yuki, and self-proclaimed \"God\" Akito has gone through the past 2 seasons / 50 episodes of content that anyone should be very familiar with their circumstances, and The Final has to exacerbate that in order for not just these 4 to get to where they eventually are in their journey of reconciliation and freedom. It hasn't been the easiest for the Soma Family's 12 Zodiac animals, much less Tohru still going out of her way to save the unwanted cat Kyo, to rebut against the Soma \"God\"-complex that is Akito, and eventually coming into terms with her past and present conditions. Yuki is pretty much the same with the student council's outcast that is Machi, as is Kyo also recognizing that all that Tohru has done for him to contain his anger and \"monster\" self since Season 1, to forge a path for himself together with her. The Soma god that is Akito presents the biggest change as she goes from one that is liberal with her words in complete anger, to eventually having to notice that she cannot keep them by her side forever. And the symbolism of the breaking of bonds within the Soma Family signifies the long-awaited change in her and between the cunning fox of a \"headmaster\" that is Shigure awaiting to show her true self to him. In essence, everyone got their closures, including the past hidden pairings like Rin and Hatsuharu.\n",

Even the OST, which since Season 2, has a K-Pop and J-Pop mix to it (which is more prevalent these days), and yeah, nothing else to say than that it's standard songs that rhyme well with the core theme of Fruits Basket.\n",

With the Final signalling the TRUE end of the legendary work after 20 long years, we can finally bid goodbye to Fruits Basket and its notoriety of a massive reputation that's truly well deserved of an unorthodox formula undertaken to showcase why this series is still popular to this day, even in the future.\n",
