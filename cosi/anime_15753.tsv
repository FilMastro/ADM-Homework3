Get Back on the Hill	Movie	1	1974-01-01 00:00:00		106			15753	17700	This film was made based on Tanaamiâ€™s fear of heights and his experience of seeing New York from the rooftop of a 50-floor apartment. Even the quotidian activity of walking across a zebra crossing becomes an abstract image observed from these heights. Using the process of color separation, the colors shift across each frame and create a surreal universe.  (Source: Collaborative Cataloging Japan)		[]	[]	[['Tanaami Keiichi', ['Director']]]
