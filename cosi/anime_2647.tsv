Selection Project	TV	13	2021-10-01 00:00:00		21931	7.25	3297	2647	3841	Due to a weak heart, Suzune Miyama has remained bedridden for most of her childhood. However, despite her illness, she has always dreamed of becoming an idol. Eventually, her opportunity comes in the form of the seventh Selection Project—a brutal series of competitions best known as the starting point of the legendary idol Akari Amasawa.  Anxious but excited, Suzune enters the preliminary round of Selection Project. Though her singing dazzles the judges and her fellow competitors, Suzune is unfortunately overcome by her nerves and freezes up in the middle of her performance. She recovers quickly, but the stumble is great enough that she loses the winning spot and is disqualified.  Or so it seems—until Seira Kurusu, the girl Suzune lost to, announces that she plans to drop out of Selection Project, believing Suzune is a more talented singer and therefore deserves the right to compete. Suzune is caught off guard by the decision, but promises Seira that they will meet again as top idols. She prepares herself for the challenging obstacles that lie ahead.
