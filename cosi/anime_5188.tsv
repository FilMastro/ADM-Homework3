On the first day, Yoshiki reconnects with his childhood friend, Takuya Saotome, and meets his odd and dramatic homeroom teacher, Teruhiko Saionji. Yoshikiâ€™s younger sister, Yuu, is aware of many of these handsome boys and seems to take pleasure in teasing her big brother about them.  Yoshiki soon discovers a number of stereotypical romance characters and has no choice but to deal with their outright ludicrous and nonsensical boys' love antics.
