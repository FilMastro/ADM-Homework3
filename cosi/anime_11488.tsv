Chou Henshin Cosprayers Specials	Special	3	2004-07-16 00:00:00	2004-07-26 00:00:00	2052	4.98	892	11488	9368	These three specials came with the DVD release. They mostly depict stories that take place in-between episodes from the main series.  Special #1 takes place in-between episodes 2 and 3.  Special #2 takes place in-between episodes 3 and 4.  Special #3 doesn't fit very well in-between any of the main series, and is more of a side-story.
