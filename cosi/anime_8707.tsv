Instead, small scale wars break out all over the Earth. Meanwhile, a large robot appears who protects the weak. It is called ""Dancougar Nova"". Some even call it God.   However, no one knows the reason for its existence - not even its pilots.  Then, another robot, beyond anyone's expectations, reveals itself as the true enemy and begins its attack on the Earth.   Dancougar Nova retaliates against this enemy with a power that was kept secret until now. Will Dancougar Nova be able to save the Earth? The prelude to this explosive confrontation rings out.
