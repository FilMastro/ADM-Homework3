Kobara Support is a fruit flavored drink for those with an upset stomach, dieting, or ill. These people would have difficulty eating normal foods so when Kobara Support is drunk on an empty stomach (which is high in acid), a chemical reaction occurs where the stomach acid and the pectin fiber to become carbonated foam. This expands and doubles in volume while turning into jelly.
