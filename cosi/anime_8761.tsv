The idea of having a miniature town was one of Yonezu's first when planning the album, and he created characters and stories for the people who lived in the town. Yonezu considers the lyrics of ""vivi"" to be the closest to his own feelings.  (Source: Wikipedia)"	['Koi to Byounetsu']	[]	[]	[['Yonezu Kenshi', ['Director', 'Music']]]
