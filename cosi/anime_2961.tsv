Genius Party	Movie	7	2007-07-07 00:00:00		33225	7.18	11252	2962	3129	A collection of seven individual and unique shorts which range from touching to downright bizarre. With each story different from the last, we encounter monsters going to school, a man who has a hard time dealing with himself, and a child who learns the hard way about the circle of life, as well as many other unique characters and experiences.  A journey through the minds of the most prolific artists in Japan, this compilation truly is the setting of a Genius Party.
