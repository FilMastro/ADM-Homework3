Police chronicles the tales of Mega-Tokyo's special police division designed to control rogue Boomers in the city. A.D. Police Officer Kenji Sasaki faces a major dilemma: he loses another partner to a rabid boomer. A day after he's sent off-duty, he receives a new partner in the form of German cop Hans Kleif. Funny thing is that Kenji sucker-punched Hans at a bar the night before. Not only does Kenji face the everyday task of controlling Boomers, he has to learn to adjust with his new partner.   (Source: ANN)  	['Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040', 'AD Police', 'Parasite Dolls']	['Sasaki, Kenji', 'Kleif, Hans', 'Miyano, Kyouko', 'Wilson, Nancy']	['Chiba, Susumu', 'Yamazaki, Takumi', 'Kawasumi, Ayako', 'Nozawa, Yukari']	[['Nagai Masaru', ['Producer']], ['Ueda Hidehito', ['Director', 'Episode Director', 'Storyboard']], ['Fujimoto Jirou', ['Episode Director']], ['Nakanishi Nobuaki', ['Episode Director']]]
