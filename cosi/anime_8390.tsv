Memory	Movie	1	1964-09-21 00:00:00		2696	6.06	1525	8390	8666	This is a short, privately produced animated film. While elucidating the mystery and fuzziness as well as merits and demerits of memory in idealizing reality, the story develops into a tale of destruction of human beings, turning the existence of the earth into a memory of the universe. The production, only 5 minutes long, greatly helps expand the viewer's imagination, embodying the enchantment of animation.  (Source: AniDB)		[]	[]	[['Tezuka Osamu', ['Director']]]
