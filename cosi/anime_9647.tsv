Byulbyul Iyagi	Movie	6	2005-09-23 00:00:00		416	5.73	105	9647	13455	"Six animated shorts about discrimination and being different.   1. ""Daydream"" talks about dealing with people with disability. It homes in on the daily life of a father with a daughter whose hands and feet are deformed.   2. ""Animal Farm"" relies on the rough-and-ready feel of stop-motion clay animation to create a satire of bullying and mob dynamics.   3. ""At Her House"" paints a devastating picture of gender inequality within a marriage.   4. ""Flesh and Bone"" gently pillories superficiality and the obsession with outward appearance.   5. ""Bicycle Trip"" focuses on the discrimination experienced by foreign workers in Korea.  6. ""Be a Human Being"" looks at the way young Koreans are barely treated as human beings before they get to university.   (Source: ANIWEBLOG, ASIANDB, Jeonju)"	['Byulbyul Iyagi 2']	[]	[]
