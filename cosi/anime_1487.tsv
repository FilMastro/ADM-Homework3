Date A Bullet: Dead or Bullet	Movie	1	2020-08-14 00:00:00		76117	7.54	25612	1486	1952	Soon after falling into another world, Kurumi Tokisaki takes interest in a particular white cat. Much to Kurumi's disappointment, the two part ways.  Kurumi later meets Hibiki Higoromo, a white haired quasi-spirit. Hibiki explains that they are at the center of a killing game between quasi-spirits. Within the Neighboring World, the spirits compete for a single wish to be granted to the lone survivor of the death-match.  Understanding the rules of the game, Kurumi and Hibiki reach a compromiseâ€”a temporary alliance.
