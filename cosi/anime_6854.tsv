Traveler Tortov Roddle encounters a curious patch of red berries and after sampling one, happily indulges himself with more. He soon realizes, however, that this delectable fruit has considerable hallucinogenic effects and finds himself partaking in his greatest trip of all.   Elsewhere, a little girl finds brief yet fantastical escapes from her everyday life. In yet another city, residents are baffled when giant black apples begin raining down from the sky, but find that they may have use for them. A journey into the extraordinary, Aru Tabibito no Nikki Specials explores the surreal occurrences of its setting, and how the land's inhabitants react to certain dreamlike experiences they encounter.
