Kumichou Musume to Sewagakari	TV				2874				8815	"WHO'S YOUR NANNY?  Tooru Kirishima is the right-hand man of the Sakuragi crime family. For him, the job is a perfect excuse to let his violent instincts run wild, earning him the nickname ""The Demon of Sakuragi."" It seems like nothing will stand in the way of his vicious nature. But then one day, he receives an assignment like never before from the bossâ€”babysitting his daughter!  This is the heartwarming (or is it bloodcurdling?) story of a little girl and her yakuza caretaker!
