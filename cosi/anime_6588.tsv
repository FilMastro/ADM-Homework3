One day, an angel named ""Devilun"" that looks like a Tasmanian devil appears before her, and grants her the power to be the beautiful magical girl dinosaur angel warrior ""Prima Angel,"" and tells her to fight the evil ""Darkness Whales"" organization. She proceeds to indiscriminately take out Darkness Whales members with weapons that stink of blood. The protagonists are three boy classmates of Kurumi who watch the entire thing while not really doing anything.  (Source: ANN)"	['Seizei Ganbare!
