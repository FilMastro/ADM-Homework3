The club, while lacking popularity, definitely does not lack potential. During their debut performance, they were able to seize a sizable audience, along with the attention of their schoolmates Ayumu Uehara and Yuu Takasaki.  Enamored, the duo makes their way to join the club; however, they are disappointed to find out that the club had just been disbanded. Nevertheless, Ayumu does not believe that it should have ended there. Together with Yuu, they begin restoring the school idol club, hoping to recreate the idol performances that dazzled them before.

Taking the first step toward their dreams, how will these girls achieve idol stardom?  [Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Love Live! School Idol Project', 'Love Live! Sunshine!!', 'Love Live!
