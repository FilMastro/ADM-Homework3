Maze☆Bakunetsu Jikuu	OVA	2	1996-07-24 00:00:00	1996-09-21 00:00:00	2974	6.07	1139	8361	8398	Maze has gained incredible powers traveling through time and space, but she has also acquired one rather large problem: every night she turns into a really horny man. Unfortunately, Maze must rescue an equally lascivious princess from a mysterious warrior cult. Still, the male version of Maze would rather be chasing tail than rescuing willing princesses.
