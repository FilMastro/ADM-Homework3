Batsu & Terry	Movie	1	1987-03-14 00:00:00		570	6.14	120	7964	12606	Bats & Terry are the two tough guys in the school. They don't take crap from anyone, not even teachers. They will fight anyone necessary, and will defend strangers (especially pretty girls) from danger. They're good at it too. Some people are in terror of them, and some love them.  When they rescue one especially pretty girl from a gang they fight over her, but it's all friendly and they both recognize that she has some scars. The police hassle them and yet admire them when they break up the gang.  Oh, and they're the star pitcher and catcher for the high school baseball team!
