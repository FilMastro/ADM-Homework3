Bavel no Hon	Special	1	1996-10-14 00:00:00		2758	5.60	1603	10057	8598	A boy and his young sister were curious about the book someone had left on a bench, and they opened the book. Then the small Tower of Bavel was completed on a page. Looking into the tower, they found an old man sitting and reading a book, surrounded by innumerable books. As the man turned pages, mythical animals appeared and disappeared.  (Source: yamamura-animation.jp)		['Sister']	['Makino, Yui']	[['Yamamura Koji', ['Director', 'Creator']]]
