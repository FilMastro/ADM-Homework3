Unfortunately Giulio struggles staying awake during the day which angers his family and teacher. Giulio struggles with his father hating him for the lowered grades and keeping the burden off his father who is falling ill from overwork. Giulio decides that his love for his father means that his father's health is more important, even if it means his father will hate him more. One night, the cat knocks over the address book and awakens his father. Finally, it is uncovered that Giulio has been doing and his father falls to tears.		[]	[]
