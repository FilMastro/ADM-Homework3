"""Hataraku"" no 100-nenshi"	ONA	1	2021-08-18 00:00:00		85			14700	17962	"It's been almost 100 years since the ""salaryman"" type of office worker first appeared in Japan back in the 1920s.  As our society faces a major turning point, SmartHR decided to create a brand film to reflect upon how work styles have changed with time over the past century.
