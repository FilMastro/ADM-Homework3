The centerpiece of the commemorative website is a new animated musical short featuring the song ""Shinesekai"" (New World) by the band Bump of Chicken.  The video centers on a middle school boy-meets-high school girl scenario. They are surrounded by a wide range of characters who are all ""spirits"" of various Lotte snacks, such as a men's singing group representing Ghana chocolate bars and, well, Koalas representing Koala March.
