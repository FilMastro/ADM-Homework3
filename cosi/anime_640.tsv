Whether the activity is an arm wrestling contest or making pancakes together, the group of entertainment-seekers are sure to give it their all.  The club members are often joined by their friends in the Student Council, who know how to have a good time as well. While it can get a little chaotic when all eight girls get together, it sure doesn't stop them from meeting up and having fun!
