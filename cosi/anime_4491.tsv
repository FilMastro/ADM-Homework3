Consequently, the Rakuga Kingdom in the sky, powered by such energy, is now at risk of collapsing onto the cities below. For any hope to avoid such a catastrophe, the kingdom's princess hastily seeks out a hero from Earth capable of wielding the ""Miracle Crayon.""   While the kingdom's reformers arrive on land to seize Earth, the magical crayon finds itself in the hands of Shinnosuke ""Shin-chan"" Nohara. In a journey that will test the limits of childlike imagination, Shin-chan must harness his creativity to secure the safety of his home and restore peace to both worlds.
