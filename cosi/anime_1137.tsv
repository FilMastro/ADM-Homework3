This success pushes the Fairy Tail guild closer to being crowned the overall champions, but obtaining victory isn't the only challenge they face. A mystery still surrounds a hooded stranger and the ominous Eclipse Gate, leaving more questions than answers.  More crazy adventures are on the horizon for Fairy Tail as their destructive antics and joyful rowdiness continue unabated.
