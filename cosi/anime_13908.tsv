Tonbo ni Natta Yat-chan	OVA	1	1973-01-01 00:00:00		78			13908	18052	A traffic safety film for elementary schoolers. Yat-chan was a young boy who knew traffic rules but proceeded to not follow them because he thought playing in the street was more important. He gets into an accident and passes away. Miko is his childhood friend and classmate and is devastated at the loss. The film ends with her aggressively crying as the sun sets and a dragonfly passes by.  In a non-traditional manner of traffic safety films, the short film aims at an emotional tactic rather than teaching safety rules. As a way to guilt children into following traffic rules they already know because their death would rip apart those who love them. 	['Yat-chan to Kasei no Ko']	[]	[]
