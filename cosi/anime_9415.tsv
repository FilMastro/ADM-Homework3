Kyoto Animation: Hoshi-hen	Special	1	2011-08-19 00:00:00		4122	5.79	2172	9415	7553	An incomplete storyboard rests on a desk. Within it, are a boy and girl who suddenly jump to life and escape the confines of the sheet of paper in order to kickstart their storyâ€”one defined by their own actions. As they journey across the desk, the world around them begins to transform and signals the start of their vivid new adventure.
