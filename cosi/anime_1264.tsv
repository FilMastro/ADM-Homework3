The iDOLM@STER	TV	25	2011-07-08 00:00:00	2011-12-23 00:00:00	138898	7.62	45730	1264	1260	765 Production Studio manages the unique talents of 13 professional idols as they slowly make their way to the top and become country-wide celebrities. But the girls' journey is far from just fun and games: hard work, sweat, and tears are some of the prerequisites needed to flourish in this industryâ€”and for 765 Pro in particular, a watchful eye out for their rival, the infamous 961 Production.  As the girls' fame grows, however, their time together as a family diminishes, and now the very popularity they sought is threatening to tear them apart. A difficult balance of work and bonding must be achieved, or they risk everyone going their separate ways. The personal and professional ordeals of these idols can't be conquered alone, but with each other's loving support, any obstacle or hardship can be overcome!
