Kong Hongjun first entered the Datang Exorcism Division, and the head supervisor was actually Long Wujun general Li Jinglong who had dealt with it not long ago. But he accidentally broke the Chen's heart lamp, and the heart lamp entered Li Jinglong's body. In the light and shadow of the lamp, there are the bright red lights of Pingkangli, the exorcism of the sycamore in the summer sunshine, the vast sky and sand and flying snow, the peaceful singing of Artai.
