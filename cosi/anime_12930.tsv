Ruby then takes Choco to her room, and the two 'transport' themselves to the Rainbow Village. There, Ruby hears an explanation from Ling Ling, the mayor of Rainbow Village, and transforms herself using her Rainbow Roller into an appropriate clothing to solve problems. Each episode concludes, back home, with another small event.  (Source: AniDB) 		['Rainbow Ruby']	[]
