After he offers her some food, she is moved by his kindness and asks him to join her organization, offering him a face mask and a sweet bun. In need of a place to stay, Asuta decides to play along and accepts her offer, adopting the nickname ""Dva.""   Little does Dva know, this cute girl is Kate Hoshimiya, the leader of Zvezda, a secret organization bent on world conquest. However, he soon realizes the true weight of her words as peculiar happenings rope him deeper into Zvezda and its eccentric membersâ€”the samurai-like vanguard Itsuka Shikabane, tech-genius Natalia ""Natasha"" Vasylchenko, troublesome Yasubee ""Yasu"" Morozumi, ex-gangster Gorou Shikabane, and multi-purpose robot Roboko Tsujii.   With ""White Light,"" a powerful organization of justice, and the entire Japanese government against them, can Zvezda really dominate all humanity and let their light shine throughout the world?
