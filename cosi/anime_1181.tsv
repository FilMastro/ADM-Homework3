Nothing seems impossible for him when he utilizes his military strength, intellect, and Geass power of absolute obedience.   However, obstacles in the face of the uprising never cease, putting Lelouch in a difficult predicament. Most worryingly, Suzaku Kururugi's combat prowess and the appearance of a mysterious child named V.V. threaten to put an end to Lelouch's great rebellion.
