Marginal#4: Kiss kara Tsukuru Big Bang	TV	12	2017-01-12 00:00:00	2017-03-30 00:00:00	14838	6.70	4160	5101	4535	The freshly debuted idol group Marginal#4 dreams of delivering their kisses to the end of the galaxy. Composed of Atom Kirihara, Rui Aiba, and the twins L and R Nomura, Marginal#4 aims to reach the top of the idol world, following in the footsteps of Pythagoras Productions' previous idol group, Lagrange Point.  When they aren't performing, however, the boys of Marginal#4 are ordinary high school students. From securing a club room and chasing down missing underwear to filming commercials, their days are packed with various hijinks. As the boys navigate a flurry of events, they try to become shooting star sensations and charm the hearts of their fans, known as the Starclusters.
