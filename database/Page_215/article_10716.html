  <meta content="Ten years ago, a fairy by the name of Daisy appeared and asked the child Eiji Hoshimiya what his one and only wish was. Although his wish remains a mystery, the consequences were catastrophic. In an event called the &quot;Great Destruction,&quot; the world started to fall apart as everything collapsed and countless people died. Now, Eiji is a high school student whose only concern is his sick sister. He does not remember what he wished for; all that he remembers is that his wish caused the Great Destruction. In the years since that event, thousands of other people have also received abilities to make their heart's desire come true. These people called &quot;Orders&quot; are believed to be evil and are hated by the general public. However, some of these Orders are after Eiji's life in vengeance for those that he killed. Will Eiji be able to survive the numerous assassination attempts? And the biggest mystery of all: what did he wish for, and what were his intentions in wishing for something that caused so much desolation? [Written by MAL Rewrite]" property="og:description"/>

              Ten years ago, a fairy by the name of Daisy appeared and asked the child Eiji Hoshimiya what his one and only wish was. Although his wish remains a mystery, the consequences were catastrophic. In an event called the "Great Destruction," the world started to fall apart as everything collapsed and countless people died.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Now, Eiji is a high school student whose only concern is his sick sister. He does not remember what he wished for; all that he remembers is that his wish caused the Great Destruction. In the years since that event, thousands of other people have also received abilities to make their heart's desire come true. These people called "Orders" are believed to be evil and are hated by the general public. However, some of these Orders are after Eiji's life in vengeance for those that he killed. Will Eiji be able to survive the numerous assassination attempts? And the biggest mystery of all: what did he wish for, and what were his intentions in wishing for something that caused so much desolation?

               I am but a mere man. I am not worthy of experiencing such greatness, but our lord and savior Mirai Nikki's Author is a merciful god. He hath brought upon us Big Order, a masterpiece that must be witnessed by all.

               The story topples even the greatest of literary works. William Shakesphere and Mark Train wish they'd live to see this anime. It is about a young man named Edgy Yukiteru, who wishes to conquer the world after obtaining a Stand that allows him to control anything within an uncertain area. See how mighty Edgy is as his powers let him break out of any situation

                that is most convenient for the plot! Crucial plot elements like "drama" and "tension" shalt not exist in this grand adventure, for they are mere illusions created by humans. Big Order transcends our reality and is above such trivial things, and the great god Edgy cannot hope to be harmed by anything due to his awesome power.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                But, alas! Harsh trials await our dear Edgy, as he doesn't use his power in the most effective ways. Is it because he lacks intelligence? Heavens, no! One must not underestimate this seraph, for he is merely toying with his enemies and giving them the faintest chance of victory, allowing the intricate narrative to play its part. Such mighty foes lurk in the dark, with power over nuclear weapons and innocent hostages. Such cruelty! But that's not all! The entire world foolishly misunderstands Edgy's celestial presence as they blame him for the deaths of billions of people. With this, we are given an extraordinarily realistic representation of real people; it's as if the show were actually filmed live from a rally of the glorious Donald Trump! And even Edgy's friends are mysterious characters as he peacefully neglects to control them by force. Is there anyone he can trust!?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Yea, Edgy does indeed have a loyal follower, his lone younger sister. A pure and innocent being, she plays a key role in the story as the motivation and love interest of our hero, for his order is dedicated to only her. Such a human relationship, it's as if the show were actually filmed live from a rally of the glorious Donald Trump! The adoration of his blessed imouto fills him with determination and motivates the audience to cheer on their beloved icon even more!
                <br/>
                <br/>
                See the intensity of the challenging duels between Order Users as they clash together; their gorgeous avatars dazzle the eyes of the audience, but only for a short time. While these battles appear to only last moments with few actions taking place, it is merely a sample of what lies hidden away. Our sinful beings are not worthy of witnessing the true battles of the gods, and such we are limited to quick brawls with ordinary tactics and simple abilities. Be grateful for what you have, mortal.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Truly, no words can describe some of the bold details of the writing; I cannot name specifics, for that would be spoiling and therefore tarnishing the mystical plot, but you cannot prepare thy rear enough for them! Big Order is a shocking and surprising series with amazing dialogue and entertainingly absurd ideas that are sure to boggle your mind. When one thinks they know the secrets and intricate details of the world, they are greeted with new, astonishing discoveries. Such is the truth with Big Order.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The cast is nothing short of brilliant. Edgy is truly an hero whose intellect and manliness is unmatched, as is depicted with the impregnation of Rei. His personality is locked away from all others--including us, the lesser audience. His lack of characteristics truly make him the perfect being. His short-lived accomplice, Yuno Gasai, is a murderous wench who seeks to destroy Edgy, but her attempts always end in failure, providing us with amusement. Only in Big Order shall you see menacing villains turned into comical relief! And the saintly Rei Ayanami is but an innocent wanderer in the story, but witnesses the excellence that is Edgy Yukiteru, and pledges loyalty to him for all eternity for small, simple reasons. May we all follow her example, for we too have small, simple reasons for our lives.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Appropriately, Big Order is depicted through art that surpasses the fine works of Michael Angelo, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bob Ross, and so on. The holy Stands are gorgeously portrayed by fine computer-generated animation reminiscent of the year 2003, a golden age when shrubbery was leading a great country and Nickelodeon broadcasted amusing content. After all, if we are to go forward, we must go back. Studio Assread has once again proven to be the future of the anime industry. And no other anime has such breathtaking and unique character designs like Big Order does; they are masterfully crafted and gorgeous to watch. Some say they are “fanservice-y”, but that is merely a sin they have brought upon themselves for thinking such dirty things. It’s only natural for a lady with rock powers to have rock-hard nipples, and it is your duty to respect that. Shame on you. It’s no wonder why many viewers have reported sights of an Ultralight Beam covering much of their filthy screens; it is only visible to the eyes of sinners to prevent them from further descension. Should you repent, you may one day become capable of viewing the mature content like a responsible adult.

                Ah, the great sounds of jazz! An elegant series such as this has but the most charming of music pieces to accompany it. No matter the scene or situation, the power of brass trumpets and saxophones will sound triumphantly. The opening theme, performed by none other than the esteemed Babymetal, is an explosive tune that is sure to rock the audience, and the ending credits is a haunting, hallowing experience that leaves you craving another episode. But they cannot compare to the greatness of the jazzy soundtrack.
                <br/>

                ...Oh, dear reader. How have you managed to read this much without rushing over to legally view this sanctifying experience!? Run along, my friend! Tell your friends and family about the good news, salvation is here! We have truly found perfection, and it is none other than the ten episodes of Big Order!

               Big Order is a mess. A real BAD mess. I don't think I've seen another anime with such bizarre execution, themes and ideas while also tripping over itself at every opportunity faster than the time grandma fell down the stairs. This show was so bad that I thought it was a joke or a satire of anime conventions. Boy, was I wrong. While, certainly, there were many parts of the anime I would classify as "so bad it's good", by the end, the narrative became even more of a convoluted mess and all fun I had with the series quickly diminished. Hell, when I saw
               <span id="review220945" style="display: none;">
                the announcement for this show, I initially thought it was going to be a slice of life series about working in the fast-food industry. After learning that in fact, it was the same author as Mirai Nikki, I understood why it was such a big mess but I think this is far worse than Mirai Nikki in terms of writing, normally an author gets better over time, not the other way around.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                This doesn't help either that every character in Big Order looks like rejects from Mirai Nikki. To be perfectly fair this is expected to a certain extent since manga authors usually have a particular style or way of designing characters but the likeness of Nikki certainly felt more so reductive than innovative.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Big Order's narrative begins with an extremely vague flying woman who goes around granting wishes to people, She eventually comes across the main character who informs her that he wishes to destroy the world since he was influenced by his favorite cartoon...the world was destroyed by a FUCKING cartoon. After the protagonist commits genocide, the narrative picks up ten years into the future (because fuck continuity) were we see the world has not been destroyed, and even after a massive calamity, society seems to have progressed enough to build another school. I certainly haven't lived through a disaster like the world being destroyed but I highly doubt a school or sometimes whole cities would still be running, but hey, this show doesn't care about its worldbuilding so why should I? The show shortly establishes that this woman, named Daisy, had been granting wishes to many other people too, who are thus given the label of "orders" and are hated by the remaining populace.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Just a small tidbit if you'd please excuse me, but if Daisy was granting random wishes to people, then why on earth didn't anyone wish for the world to be fixed or something? Was Eiji  (our genocide protagonist) the last person she ever granted a wish to? Anyway, Eiji is incredibly annoying. He is an edgy as fuck teenager and the world hates him, while also having a rather intimate relationship with his sister. Why? I don't know, incest is going to be in every bad show now? And it's not like it's subtle either. They literally have sex with each other. Neat. While on his way home from school one day, Eiji is attacked by a Yuno clone (minus everything that made Yuno a fun character). She vows vengeance on Eiji since his wish caused the great destruction which killed her parents. During this fight, he showcases his power which literally looks like a poor man's version of a stand from JoJo. In fact, every power is literally a JoJo stand except they're all CG and look like shit and none of the powers are ever developed or explained.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Anyway, Eiji can control things within his 'domain' and manipulate things within that space to do whatever he says...so not only is this show like JoJo, it's also like Code Geass, he even wants to take over the world in the name of peace like Lelouch. While Yuno-clone is in this domain, she is unable to kill Eiji but over the course of the show begins to fall in love with him which is the dumbest thing I've ever heard because he kinda says that he will marry her or something...this makes no fucking sense.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                After deciding to take over the world for the sake of world peace and to protect his sister and is made king of some kind of organization or whatever... I don't fucking care anymore. Why should I care when the anime gives me no reason to. We're introduced to all these characters who are supposedly the strongest but they barely have any screen time and pretty much are useless
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The plot is all over the god damn place and nothing makes any sense what so ever. Things happen at random, all of the characters are stupid beyond belief. We rush through the plot at breakneck speed never allowing for any plot or character development at all. No character is likable in the slightest and no one is ever developed. For a while, the show could be pretty entertaining since it was so bad it was good. Such as in episode 4 when a nuke is dropped right above Eiji's head and he stops it his bare hands. Wouldn't it explode? Why didn't the people aim the nuke a few miles away from their location to ensure that it can't be stopped? Who fucking cares.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The anime tries way too hard to be edgy featuring plenty of leg and arm amputations and some of the worst censoring I have seen in a long time for any kind of nudity. Don't you love scenes that are 90% white light?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                There were some parts that were just fucking dumb. Like the one scene in which Eiji touches the ears of the Miko character and she becomes pregnant. What the fuck.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The powers are never explained and lack any originality. The characters are boring and badly written, there is crappy animation and bad CGI, dull script, extremely forced plot twists that make no sense near the end and combining that with one of the worst endings I have ever seen makes for one of the worst anime of this year.

               Before I begin my review, let me get it off my chest and say that I am not one of those elite posers or trolls who is quick to hop on the bandwagon and immediately dislike the show because the original creator was Sakae Esuno, the original artist and author of Mirai Nikki or Future Dairy (whichever you prefer.)
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Let me start with this, between Future Diary and Big order, with this series it's like characters that didn't make it into The future diary got their own spin-off thus Big order was born. Just watching the first episode, the  similarities with the characters and
               <span id="review220935" style="display: none;">
                to a certain degree the story are of course obvious. Certain characters resemble, and to a certain extent act/behave almost the way characters in Future Diary did. In all honesty, it's like he made the same story twice but (Obviously) tweaked little things in the story, plot, etc to try to give Big order its own unique individuality. For the most part I think that it works out pretty well. I'm not saying that Sakae is a bad writer, it's just that he needs to do a better job with making better distinctions with each of his works, that way it doesn't feel like the two shows are blending into each other. Unless of course he's doing this to make it seem like they take place in the same sort of universe however... we all (most of us) know how the universes in Future Dairy work out.. cough cough.  That aside, I could not establish any type of commitment to the story [for the most part.] I will certainly say that it is not Esuno's best work however, I am roughly around 86.7% convinced that he can do a better job with creating an engaging and intensely dramatic story-line [along with plot] that's not only fun to watch but also really keeps viewers like me satisfied and engaged with what's going on. To me it seems like he purposely adds, or "tries too hard" to keep his work "dark" while trying to add fear into the factor and it just wasn't working for me. I mean, [and I'm going to try to stop bringing up the future dairy because again this is a different work] with the future dairy I was very satisfied with The story &amp; plot. It was full of drama and the studio, producers, and director did a great job of adding mystery and a bit of action parts to the story. Which kept me engaged for a majority of the time.
                <br/>
                Big order really felt like (and I hate to use this word) but laziness, pure laziness. Now things did pick up for me after episode 5. To me, this is the point where the show finally start getting somewhat serious in both dialogue and starting drama. I cannot spoil anything but I loved the intense amount of dramatic battles, fights between Eiji and his squad. I was glad that things started to pick up in Big order. Because there are only 10 episodes, if things didn't pick up around episode 5-6 I probably would've lost interest and dropped it. Il would probably had stuck to my guns and watched it anyway simply because once I start a show I make a commitment to see it through. Overall, I felt like dialogue between characters was dull, action scenes didn't really land a spark and it lacked an engaging story-line along with plot. I gave the 6.5 outta 10 because I didn't feel like Sakae had used his full potential.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The animation, special effects, and CGI used during the show were pretty good however nothing major stands out too much to me. When I'm watching battle scenes I often times felt like it was missing a certain charm.  Perhaps they lacked intensity &amp; replay value.  I was expecting, "unless of course I missed some" Easter eggs or references of the future dairy, I mean I saw the ball that Kami-Musubi had looked like the same one Tsubaki in Future dairy owned however, as far as I saw, that is the limit to how far Easter eggs go. Now character designs, the resemblances, I felt like at the very least the producers could have at least adjusted Eiji, Tairano, Daisy, Rin, and so many other characters original designs to look much different. This is because they stand out too much and look like the future dairy cast. They appear as cheesy, uninspired rip offs.  Sakae shouldn't draw Yukiteru and make him look more mature and call him "Eiji." He shouldn't draw  Yuno make her look like a dolled up idol star and call her "Daisy." More importantly he should not! and I mean should not! have taken Yuno's infamous "Yandere archetype" and Minene's cold, tough girl attitude and gave it to Kurenai I just think that lacks a bit of creativity. Overall, despite all of this I'm still satisfied with the final results.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I disliked all the characters. I don't know how much I can go into so I'll just put it bluntly. Big order has the most dullest, and lackluster characters I have seen in some time. Each character lacked their own unique individuality. As I mentioned many times before, the characters, for the most part are just copy and pasted from Mirai Nikki albeit with some changes. Character growth and development wasn't exciting because Eiji literally has an OP gift "order." Although he does have this power he is often times beaten by other important characters but of course he cannot lose because you know, he's the main character. If I had to change anything from Esuno's work,  I would make characters more appealing in terms of personality, uniqueness and how they appeal to the viewers. Creativity and most importantly memorable characters in big order isn't possible for me because again, all I saw was laziness.  Overall I was beyond disappointed with the characters and this is the first time! This is perhaps the first and hopefully the last time I have to watch a show with a cast full of bad characters.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The soundtrack was pretty good but no too impressive. Music is not as powerful and dramatic as the future diary soundtrack however, there are  still has a few good songs here to hear playing in the background here and there. Voice actors were pretty good so I don't have much to complain about in that department. Overall I didn't care too much about the soundtrack.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Let me just say that I wasn't exactly too fond of what I watched. I'm not going to say that it was completely bad because, as I mentioned earlier, the show does deliver lots of great moments however, in the long run, I felt like it was wasted potential. Overall I think it needed a lot of work in story and especially the characters department.

               <br/>
               Big Order is an enigma. It's beyond our comprehension, in the worst way possible. It throws you for all kinds of loops in the dumbest, more surreal ways imaginable, thinking that's it's a clever, emotional, deep, and truly thought-provoking being when in reality, it's a sloppy, horrifically told mess. Trying to really understand everything about it is to succumb to a Lovecraftian horror that will destroy your mind and soul since it actually manages to be both convoluted in all the potentially interesting and deep ways while fucking it all up and being convoluted the wrong ways. It doesn't answer all the
               <span id="review249467" style="display: none;">
                right questions we are left with, and it sometimes answers them in ways that make things worse. Hell, it doesn't even understand the revolting implications of some of its characters actions, so how the hell can it expect to understand the major plot it has created?

                <br/>
                It's actually futile to try to understand this anime since it doesn't even understand itself that well. It's like it's final antagonist, trying to delve deep into something it was never gonna truly get, making detrimentally wrong decisions, and losing sight of what it tried to do as it went and tried to one-up itself in "craftiness" and "mind-bending twists". It knows what it's trying to be, but that it's trying to be is something it cannot handle, which is truly fitting given that many of its characters suffer that exact same fate. So, just how badly did Big Order implode in on itself? Or rather, just what happened to make it suffer that fate? Well, let's find out, shall we?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Basically, 10 years ago, Eiji made a wish that ended up destroying the world, add that wish was to dominate it for world peace. Now, you're asking why didn't he say "I want world peace"? The thing is, it wasn't his actual wish, it was his sister's. I know I'm jumping the gun but I need to tackle this early. The flashbacks make it seem like she's a girl who can comprehend full conversations and the state of our worlds as well as empathy by then we learn she was only 3, making this make little sense since actual 3 year olds don't do any of that. I know this because the flashback specifically states 10 years ago, as well as the fact that in the final episode, she turns 14 soon after the major events of the final episode. Now, basically, the plot tries to one up itself in terms of stringing its MC along for all sorts of twists, turns, betrayals, etc., so let's tackle some of them, as well as a few other moments and see what went wrong, shall we? After all, it's hard to really describe the plot well given how wrecked it is, but we can attack it's logic and see why the story falters, in sort of a rapid fire kind of fashion, though this isn't my usual formula.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                When Kurenai Rin stabs Eiji's sister (Sena) in the shoulder with a sword and she bleeds horribly, you'd expect that when Eiji reaches her far more than 10 minutes later given how the episode presents itself, that she would actually be dead from blood loss. Eiji takes down two heavily armed and protected dudes by going ham with a sign (that was never shown), so yeah, that's dumb. If Rin wanted to finish off Eiji herself, she definitely shouldn't have ordered her men to riddle him with bullets (regardless of the fact that it didn't even work). When Eiji effectively puts her in his dominion, or rather, when he uses his order to block the shots before he uses his dominion order, she, for no reason, heals Sena and he never even ordered to. She wants to know why, and neither she nor we get a definite answer since we never hear him tell her to heal his sister. Barring the stuff I listed above that ultimately is explained away by the big Sena twist, this is basically all of the really crazy illogical moments from episode 1. Keep that in mind. Also at the end of the episode, Eiji uses his Order avatar to wrap Rin and given the audio and the way the episode fades to black for the credits, it basically sounds like he basically forced her into tentacle rape, and I'm not sure if they really wanted that implication or maybe they did it as a joke. Dunno.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Characters betray each other for no good reason. I mean, Franc betrays the group in episode 7 for no adequately explained reason only to do a face turn, only to do another heel turn in the finale. Characters also try to outsmart each other all the time, to varying and often pathetic degrees of success in terms of making any sense, like how in episode 4, one of the 10 members working for them was pretending to work for the enemy by giving the enemy heavily compromising information that jeopardizes his side's own plans to nearly getting their pawn (Eiji) killed (even though it easing their own order), or well, everything in one ginormous sequence in episode 7 that amounts to the two leaders trying to outwit each other until they are betrayed by one of their own (Rin for the bad guys and Franc for the "good guys", except Rin's was a part of the bad guys' plan). It's like the writer(s) decided to try to make the story one-up itself in terms of convoluted schemes of planning around plans and adding in betrayals regardless of whether or not it can be easy enough to remotely follow or if it all makes sense.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Characters also don't use their OP AF powers on ways that actually make good sense in their situations. There are a few notable accounts of this. Episode 3: Eiji has the Group of 10 (what a boring name) under his dominion and claims to be in control (though that's what they want), and he doesn't even do anything to bind them under his will aside from "don't leave my domain". If he really wanted to be in control, he should've tried to make them actually submit to his power and decisions via his dominion instead of saying "you're in my dominion" and expecting them to just follow him and not get him entangled in their scenes. Episode 6: A swordsman has an inter-dimensional sword that can slash between dimensions, and when he has Eiji and Iyo in his sights (as well as a now useless colleague and Kuroko (the Miko of vitality and couples in episode 6 who is gorgeous AF), he swipes vertically to kill the latter two. Even if it's revealed that Eiji needed to be alive for his father (the main antagonist), did he swordsman know that? Why not swipe vertically to kill everyone, or if he knew that he needed Eiji alive, why not depends diagonally to try to cut off a limb to make him more susceptible to capture? Episode 10: Sena Wishes dominion over the world for world peace. Even if she was basically 3 at the time, why didn't she just wish for world peace? So that the plot could happen? There had to have been better ways of making this work, like maybe trying to justify why she didn't (like maybe she wanted to emulate the world domination aspect of her idol book comic character, or maybe she didn't think it through at all). Instead, she wished for world domination and couldn't handle the power so it fucked over the world. Also, when Eiji wished to shoulder all of the damage she did with that wish, how does it equate to him taking her power, messing both his and her memories, and basically suppressing and replacing their memories of their father? Bah! Moving on!
                <br/>
                <br/>
                As I said, this show doesn't understand any of the downright horrible implications of some of the characters' actions. Let's run down the list, shall we? The Group of Ten basically leaked info to basically ruin a high schooler's life by turning the world against him and manipulating him into their schemes just so they can kill his father and stop his plans, even knowing that both he and his sister were crucial in his plot. That literally makes no sense and the fact that they expect him to go along with it is especially galling. They basically made him a global pariah worse than Adolf Hitler, so no shit he often has a hard time of complying! In episode 4, Eiji and Sena are in bed with him on top in a very sexual position, and then we next see all of their clothes on the floor and an open shower curtain. Regardless of the fact that we only blatantly know that they're just showering together, it's very creepy for a teenage boy to shower with his not much younger sister at their ages. Also, given all of this context, you can imagine that the implications of actual incest run rampant here, which is just not good. Hell, the fact that she kisses him in the final episode of the anime (without any context to blatantly suggest otherwise), it's basically confirmed that she was wanting to have incest with him, or at least heavy implications make it come off that way.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Time for this last example to really sell my point home. In episode 9, Iyo has Eiji handcuffed to a bed with just his shirt off and they take off their clothes, but he is trying to decline sex in favor of current matters, and given the context of what's going on, it's implied from the anime that she was already sorta having sex anyway thanks to Eiji's line about her going any deeper, and again, he never actually consented and she was still trying to have sex with him. Does that sound like rape to you, because it does to me. Don't try to give me some bullshit spheal about "women can't rape men, that's not how that works; at worst, it's only physically possible for it to be sexual harassment or assault" since she had him chained up to something without his knowledge or consent and is trying to have (and given the anime's context, likely in the middle of having) sex regardless of his declining (likely because he'd rather save it for a time where his sister wasn't in danger) so that counts as attempted rape, even if none of the characters realize it as such. Do you see what I mean by horrid implications that no character seems to take into consideration regarding their actions!
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Before we get to the real meat of the convoluted nature of the series, let’s also smash a few weird ass scenes apart since, well, this anime is beyond strange. The ultimate example of this is the beginning of episode 5. Kagekiyo basically grabs and fondles the tits of Rin, Mari (the chick with the glasses and lasers), and Iyo, all while basically having an orgasm over their “twin peaks” when she fondles them enough, getting her ass kicked every time, brushing it off like it's nothing before moving to her next target, and not learning not to be such a perv to other women. All this scene adds is time and discomfort. I've already talked about the episode 4 scene that really hints at incest, so I'll tackle one more scene: Eiji gets an arm and a leg cut off in episode 8, and the moment he uses the Eiji x Iyo fusion of his Order avatar, he can suddenly manipulate his limbs to attach to him for no reason other than asspulls since it was never shown to be able to do that. I know orders defy conventional logic, but they only do that via the user’s ordered actions, not by nature of their existence.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                There’s this whole thing about how the people hate Order users because they hate Eiji for what happened to the world. Problem is, the way they go about this is hamfisted. Civilians in this show are absurdly hateful and are portrayed in this vicious, uncivilized, basically evil light. Also, you know, it seems like none of them try to move on from their grief and put it past them in order to try to live a better life. I get that their families were killed and their lives were inverted but everyone comes off as insanely hateful for the sake of it. I'll address the final thing that makes the civilians on the show horrible when we get there.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Yeah, time to delve into the big plot of the second half. Given that the anime ended a few months before the manga did, I can only assume that all of this, or at least a good chunk of it (namely the final episode or 3) was filler, though even with the research I did (without reading the manga or knowing someone who has) I cannot prove this. Well, it turns out that the Group of 10 were initially meant to track down and kill Genai, Eiji’s father, and you can refer to a few paragraphs ago on why that is horse shit when taking everything into account. Also, the bad guys are tracking down and trying to kill mikos. Apparently it's because they are involved in this pentagram involved with the gate to this mental world that he wants to unlock because it was Sena that originally did so, though she couldn't control it, causing the world to be ravaged, apparently so that he can create an infinite amount of parallel universes, including ones where Sena’s wish was granted and she was happy and world peace, even if it means forsaking the universe that we are currently seeing our characters in and everyone storms the place and betrayals and Eiji denouncing his goal and getting stabbed by his sister and then fusing orders and kicking ass and winning and God shows up and the world is now good and now that means everyone sees Eiji as a hero which makes no sense given how much whiplash that is with how hateful they were and good ending and blah blah blah! I'm not even gonna question any more aspects of the finale like the memory parasite robots or anything since my mind is fried beyond belief.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Another crucial problem is that very few of these characters have any remotely interesting personality to speak of, so I'll prattle a lot of them off quick. The Group of 10 are mostly useless, with only a few of them being relevant like the leader, Mari, Iyo, and 3 other dudes who only do one specific thing like flying, teleporting, and punching, and some of them are so useless that they don't even have any real screen time, and of course, each of them is basically one note and dull, even the fun-loving flying and punching dudes are just meh, and are just there for deus ex machinas. Even the main character Eiji is a boring teen protagonist who is basically Lelouch if he had the personality of an ordinary school protagonist, including his devotion to making his sister happy. Rin is just an annoying chick who always wants to kill Eiji until one final sappy scene where she motivates him in the final episode. Also, yeah, different hair color aside, her design is strikingly similar to that of Yuno from Mirai Nikki. Kagekiyo is just a vengeful and quirky person who also happens to be a total perv (and probably either bi or lesbian given the twin peaks scene in episode 5), and is basically irrelevant aside from episodes 3 and 4, and one scene in the finale. Also, Sena is basically a worse Nunnally who sorta is in love with her brother and is the one  actually responsible for the world ending. Plus, her heel turn in episode 9 was abominable.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Now into the full-blown antagonists. I don't even think most of them have names aside from Jyuubei (the sword guy) and Genai (the main antagonist). Aside from Genso, there nothing but generic, borderline personality-less baddies. It's sad when Fairy Tail can come up with tons of evil teams (Oración Seis, Tartarus, Grimoire Heart, Phantom Lord, and a good few others) that have each and every character have some kind of defined personality with some of them getting sort of fleshed out, and in rarer cases, even developed and yet no one here has a truly concrete personality aside from the most generic templates of a personality. Genai has this weird obsession with flowers and the series tries its damnedest to make him a sympathetic scientist father whose plans drove him insane and ruined everything for everyone, but when they can't even do a good job with his backstory, the backstory about him for one of the characters, or even how despite supposedly  caring so much for Eiji and Sena he never actually shows care after the major incident (he never looks for them orthopedic to get others to do the same, and he doesn't care how badly their hurt as long as they're alive and useful), even he misses the mark.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I can't even really begin to describe Daisy in any way that isn't how much teasing he does to Eiji about his powers and memories. She is as much of an enigma as the show itself, and I don't think it was as intentional as you might think since we know nothing about her backstory other than the fact that she was used as the vessel of an experiment that caused her to become some kind of floating person that hands out Orders. We never really see that from her perspective, nor does she really have anything concrete about her aside from her great looks and how much she teases Eiji about pertinent information. What was she like before? Did the change affect her in any way? Why did she get a job as a waitress at the end of the series! Despite being one of the more prominent characters in the series, I probably have the least feel for what kind of personality she has. Also, the only Miko we get to know aside from Iyo is Kuroko, a beautiful lady who has perfect vitality and spend her days basically forging couples, and it's funny to hear her get annoyed when Eiji and Iyo don't understand one another and have awkward moments despite them being obviously the pair that will be a couple, though she doesn't really get to do much since she was killed off unceremoniously. She was, all things considered, the best character in the show, and when a basically one-off character is the best character in your entire series, that's pretty pathetic.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The character art...is inconsistent. Sometimes it looks amazing, with all sorts of wonderful shading to complement the (mostly) wonderful (albeit sometimes borderline copy paste) character designs, and other times, it looks flat with characters having none of that shading. It would've been great if Studio Asread were capable of doing what Studio Wit did with Kabaneri and managed to have the perfect shading all the time instead of only sometimes, but hey, it's better than having the flat looking moments for the characters all the time. Only one design looks terrible and that's Kagekiyo’s, especially with those absurdly pointy nipples that stick out from her g-string big time. The actual animation isn't spectacular but ultimately competent, despite a few laughable moments like the way Eiji turns/slides in episode 2 (I bet you know the scene I'm talking about). The censorship is pretty terrible though, but not as horrid as the usual black bars or even black circles. The kaleidoscope imagery looked nice though, even if the series doesn't really do well in terms of having contrasting light and shadow in the same frame. Also, the CGI is pretty terrible, not just with the avatars, but especially with the nukes in episode 4 and just how prevalent the CGI is, also bogs it all down, especially since it doesn't work well with the aesthetic of the series, nor does it look good on its own. I do at least like when the imagery gets really triply like with the world destruction and with most of the final episode.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The OP “Disorder” by Yousei Teikoku...is certainly fitting in terms of its chaotic nature and how much of a mess Big Order is. I don't particularly like it, especially in comparison to some of her other songs like Mirai Nikki OP 1 or Deus’s character song. The ED “Kobore Sekai Oware (毀レ世カイ終ワレ)" by Aki Hata is...fascinating. Both somewhat unnerving and simultaneously alluring. I really like it, more so than any other piece of music in the series. The Actual OST is somewhat ok but is really unfitting (with tons of jazz pieces that sound like they’d be playing at certain parts of a fun spy series instead of an anime like this), and some of them, especially the track “Dominate” are played over and over again and it gets annoying since none of the tracks (aside from track 7) are particularly good. It's not that they're bad, it's that they are overused and ill-fitting most of
                <br/>
                <br/>
                For a while now, Big Order was easily the most enjoyable train wreck I had ever seen. It's decisions were so baffling and out of left field that I couldn't help but laugh my ass off constantly throughout the first 6 episodes. It wasn't enjoyable in the conventional sense and the episodes got increasingly aggravating, but the last 4 episode felt more aggravating than funny bad, mainly due to how it grew stale and unbelievably convoluted, and the fact that it tried harder than ever to be serious and heartfelt rather than crazy and fun in terms of what it was trying to do. I don't actually hate the ending, partially because I couldn't even care anymore and my mind was crashing like Hindenburg or the Titanic, and blowing up like a Megaman boss. I was more distraught by its failures than infuriated or poised to laugh at them in the last 4 episodes, especially the finale. Plus, certain implications and true ramifications of situations really broke me at times. Nonetheless, I can say that for most part, I consider it to be the first truly effective schlock title I have ever seen, in the way that I laughed my ass off constantly throughout a majority of the run, for whatever that's worth.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Big Order is an absolute mess. It's not just convoluted, but stupidly confusing and confusingly stupid. It becomes legitimately hard to grasp as to what is actually wrong with the story and what is just convoluted and/or absurd but intentional and not harmful. As your mind tries to parse all that, as well as the awful CGI and constant kaleidoscope imagery, as well as the unfitting music that makes you speculate as to what kind of series the OST would better suit, it all moves along at breakneck speeds. It's mentally taxing for sure, and not even mostly good character art, a few good songs, or even kaleidoscope imagery can remotely salvage that. You actively need to be mentally prepared to sit through this show or you will be left in the dust worse than any unprepared schmuck watching episode 20 of Ergo Proxy, which is an actually good anime that comes off as very convoluted at times. Big Order is a big pile ‘o shit and it deserves its dismal rating. It's sort of fascinating in a way if you’re capable of keeping up somewhat with the absurd narrative and decisions of the show, which is probably its biggest strength despite being fully comprised of the show’s fatal flaws. Only watch this if you're an expert at ripping bad anime to shreds. Everyone else, spare your brain cells. With all that said, I bid you adieu.
