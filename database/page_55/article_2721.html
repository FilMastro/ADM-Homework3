  <meta content="Fifty years ago, horrific creatures dubbed as the &quot;enemies of humanity&quot; suddenly appeared around the world. To combat these threats, teenagers gifted with supernatural abilities called &quot;Talents&quot;—such as pyrokinesis and time travel—hone their powers at an academy on a secluded island. Nanao Nakajima, however, is quite different from the others on the island: he has no Talent. With many &quot;Talented&quot; teenagers around him, Nanao is often a target for bullying, but even so, he still strives to complete his training. Soon after, two transfer students, the mysterious Kyouya Onodera and the mind-reading Nana Hiiragi, join the class. But just as everyone starts blending as comrades-in-arms, mysterious disappearances begin to threaten the class's entire foundation. [Written by MAL Rewrite]" property="og:description"/>

             <p itemprop="description">
              Fifty years ago, horrific creatures dubbed as the "enemies of humanity" suddenly appeared around the world. To combat these threats, teenagers gifted with supernatural abilities called "Talents"—such as pyrokinesis and time travel—hone their powers at an academy on a secluded island.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Nanao Nakajima, however, is quite different from the others on the island: he has no Talent. With many "Talented" teenagers around him, Nanao is often a target for bullying, but even so, he still strives to complete his training. Soon after, two transfer students, the mysterious Kyouya Onodera and the mind-reading Nana Hiiragi, join the class. But just as everyone starts blending as comrades-in-arms, mysterious disappearances begin to threaten the class's entire foundation.

               “Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.” ― Albert Einstein / a.k.a I don't quite understand the hate for this show. Why? Because you're plain stupid/dumb to understand, that's mean.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               What defines humanity as a whole? It's the age-old argument of stupidity. From psychology to physiology, all humans are ironically wired to have a level of stupidity, whether by a congenital lack of capacity for reasoning or temporary slow-mindedness. Don't attempt to go and defend yourself by remitting the "ignorance is bliss" adage, because while it doesn't equal stupidity, "'tis folly to be wise." Don't get me
               <span id="review370177" style="display: none;">
                wrong, the paradigm of "We're All Stupid" applies to everyone, regardless of your ability of perceive conceptualized notions. But rather than setting yourself up for failure, taking up irrational, emotional-filled oversimplifications of a mental state will be the moment to overcome stupidity and achieve true rationality. And that's what Talentless Nana aims to achieve here: over-complicated "No shit, Sherlock" acts of playing the "stupidity" game, down to the last culprit call to pursue and claim their reasonings, even to the satirical extremes of logic and twist the game even further down the rabbit hole.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                So strap in for the school-themed spatial ride, and prepare to be Crewmates, because: "There are multiple impostors Among Us!"
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If there is one quote to sum Talentless Nana as a whole, it'd be this quote by Dorkly: “Blessed are the ignorant fools of the world, for they know not the unspeakable horrors that await us all.” Nevertheless, who would've expected an unknown mangaka like Looseboy to precede a formula, that is now all the rage with Innersloth's Among Us, by 2 years no less? Yes, the show starts off as a generic My HeroAca rip-off of sorts, par with the Hero and Villain factions of the "Enemies of Humanity": siding into both Talented and Talentless (you can put two and two together and make five of who and what they are, it's all filled out for you). And no, in the sense that by the end of the first episode, it takes all that and tugs it all out of the cliff in one fell swoop, just like the Talentless Nanao Nakajima. That's how you make a convincing first impression that this is more than just your generic Shounen superpower-fest show, and yessiree, it's full of SUS. This show doesn't try to sell on its world-building and unrealistic qualities of shock factors, because it really does not need one, as predictable as it can be.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                This show only reinforces that pink-haired yanderes full of psychological thriller-esque characters are here to stay, and they certainly aren't dumb, and that's the case of female MC Nana Hiiragi. Being sent from the human side to a Hogwarts-esque concealed island filled with generic typical My HeroAca setting of "Talented" people for assassination purposes, you might think that she is just dumb to plainly follow orders from the higher-ups, but over the course of the show, there is some semblance to that and then some that's not quite so.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                First off, her role as the assassin against the egoistic "Talented" kids: she's pretty much given a smartphone that dictates all Talented and their kill-counts, but overtime, it also makes you question if covering all your tracks is worth the hassle of not being found as a psychopathic secret impostor for killing strategies, by hook or by crook. And none better at that to exert her extroverted and convincing personality of persuasion as the class leader to buy people into her segue. Secondly, her backstory covered in the 2nd half of the anime shows us the true picture of Nana as a whole: Talented or Talentless, she's just as victimized as some of the characters, and for that reason, an anthropology of how she's dealt with the knives of death and revenge growing up. And that I believe is what sells on her character aesthetic: being an annoying and hideous girl that's full of sus, but also having an imperfect heart, regardless of reasoning. A Moriarty that's unlike one if I can infer at best.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                And that brings me to the next "No shit, Sherlock" MC character: the "Talented" immortal Kyouya Onodera (and I can already hear you say: "BOO, another dumb character!"). Again, I implore you to hold your horses. Yes, a stereotypical introverted and observant Sherlock Holmes character he IS one, and no, his thought processes are really exquisite to follow and figure out in the same-old Holmes' fashion of "How does a deranged assassin's mind work? And how does he/she go around committing the crime with little to no evidence strewn from the start?", so much so that without question you're immediately sunk into the crux of the conflict and figuring out who might be the potential culprit. You tell me: "Kyouya is yet another dumbfounded character to not believe that Nana is behind it all.", but the truth of the matter is: "If Nana is found out as the main culprit, why would this story and setting exist in the first place? There's always gotta be something beneath the surface that no one could ever predict." And you'd be right on saying this, because it only keeps getting better.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                But, if there one character I can single out "playing dumb", it's Michiru Inukai. At first, she seems like most other characters that likes to play the similar archetype game at first, but like Nana, where you get to understand her better, lies in her traumatic past of being a loyal dog (er, I mean, friend). The "Talented" girl that was shunned for just about everything in her life, from the ire of normal human beings to largely being oppressed for the fact that she is a Talent. At the very core of Michiru, lies 2 different beings: one of a descent of hidden motives (that gives a headache to Nana), and the other, what you see in the anime: a kind-hearted girl that genuinely cares for the people around her, akin to a puppy licking people's wounds but with the inability to cure illnesses, and what's detrimental is that for the Talent she has, it reduces her life expectancy. So, a divisive character that can be attuned to both sides of the story, that is what makes her character special.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Otherwise, I have no words to defend the "Talented" students, because yes, they're all just plain dumb: infused for B-roll comedy (a.k.a fatso Moguo Iijima and his 3 henchmen) and plot devices to transcend both Nana and Kyouya into deep rabbit hole territory. I know, I know, there's the shapeshifting "Enemy of Humanity" human-feline Jin Tachibana with his love for animals with a psychotic-but-smart mindset, only appearing at critical times for Nana's sake in the 2nd half, but as problematic as he is, his role is better played out in future proceedings of the manga.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Speaking of the manga, it wouldn't be a one-trick pony to go off the rails with filler/original content (well, except the last episode's final moments anyways), this is one of the few manga-to-anime adaptations that has extremely close levels of concise pacing. Small nitpicks aside, not one level of detail is left from the manga, and everything depicted in the anime is an entirely 1-for-1 screenplay of shots. So for manga readers (and any hopefuls wanting to pick up the manga), what you see and read in the manga, the anime does a heck of a plentiful and focused job adapting Looseboy's source material, and props to series composer Fumihiko Shimo for paying attention and re-enacting to the precise T.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                ANN's Steve Jones commented this: "Talentless Nana is the Heybot! of Death Note." And I have to say that he is absolutely right, because director Shinji Ishihira directed both shows (save for the old-school "Shr(i)ek" that was Fairy Tail and the radiance of Log Horizon), and his directorial duty shines even brighter now with Talentless Nana at studio Bridge. Capturing the intricate details of the manga for such a low budget studio is no easy task, and combining the easy-going Heybot! setting with the psychological-thriller suspense of a screenplay, it's as the cool kids say: it's (consistently) Poggers.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In addition, the music and voice-acting is the extra layer to top to what is (IMO) already a pretty good show, even further. Miyu Tomita's OP "Broken Sky" is a great opening to get you invested into the nuances of the by-parallels of the various scene-shots (that kinda spoils the entire show in general, but not by much). What's even better is Chiai Fujikawa's ED, having performed for Shield Hero's EDs and the 1st ED of Digimon Adventure (2020), her musical class only keeps going up and higher. That's a few roles to take in for such a young 25-year-old music artist, but another masterful composition of a song that only raises her popularity even more. Not forgetting some notable veteran VAs that excel this show to new heights: Nana's VA Rumi Ookubo (to which Nana is a +1 to her well-played pink-haired repertoire), Kyouya's VA Yuuichi Nakamura (the king of SoL male MC) and Michiru's VA Mai Nakahara (part-total psychopath of Higurashi's Rena, part-sweet mother of Clannad's Nagisa). Honestly, a terrific job well done.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Overall, I'm not here to judge your tastes whether you consider Talentless Nana a boon or bane, it's either that you love the hell or hate the unrealistic ways of the show. Regardless of the insane amounts of "forced" plot twists and cliffhangers that left you wanting for more, I'm here to give an alternate view of why I think this show is "beneficial" to the current times, and only picking up after Among Us got famous overnight. Yeah sure, you can process it as a "marketing ploy", anything goes.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If you like it, then hey, fancy a mystery thriller? If not, I'll foreword with the cliché of "there is better shows out there that'd pique your interest more."

               Talentless Nana is an ugly show about a class of braindead kids with superpowers; one by one, they get murdered by the titular psychopath. It's a reverse murder mystery, meaning you have to figure out how Nana will plan a murder without being caught—rather than identifying the killer.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The premise is interesting, but the execution is disappointing. Nana's plans to murder each student rely on their stupidity to succeed. Unfortunately, the show also lacks the gore or humor to be mindless entertainment—and it's too dull to be worth watching. You barely get to see anything of the killings, except for a few dead
               <span id="review370183" style="display: none;">
                bodies. Lame. At first, I didn't like it because of the abundance of plot conveniences. Around the middle, I became used to it and enjoyed seeing dumb people get killed. By the end, I was tired of the same formula. It overused cliffhangers until I stopped caring about what would happen next week. In the end, it attempted a last-ditch effort to be profound and memorable. It was so forced and melodramatic—yet not even bad enough to be ironically funny. In a nutshell, this is a decent time-waster but ultimately disappointing.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The story takes place in the far future. A small percentage of humans are born with superpowers known as the "Talented," and without them are the "Talentless." For five years, a war was waged between the Talented and the Talentless. Cities were bombed to ashes in an attempt to genocide superpowered people. The Talented fought against the government because they didn't want to be the country's lab rats. They were stigmatized because some of them had dangerous and uncontrollable powers. Decades later, the Talented were accepted, but they're isolated from normal humans.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                You've probably heard of this premise before in great stories like X-Men and Watchmen. In Talentless Nana, the superpowered high school students get sent to "training academies" on secluded islands. Once there, the government sends an assassin to the academy to murder every student. One of those assassins is Nana.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The plot that ensues is a cat and mouse game between Nana, a pink-haired serial killer, and Kyouya, one of her superpowered classmates. In the same vein as Death Note, she is the villain-protagonist in a battle of wits against a cold and apathetic detective. They play mind games with each other like Light and L, but it's dumbed down for a teenage audience. Nana's thoughts are tinted blood-red hue, and Kyouya's are blue. So red is bad, blue is good—very simplistic symbolism, of course. We wouldn't want the children to get confused about who's the ruthless murder or the detective.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Nana and Kyouya's inner monologues are meant to be taken very seriously, but they're so cheesy it's hard not to laugh. When Nana's red filter covers the screen, she switches to her Evil Voice, and we get a close-up of her crazed face, wearing a comically evil grin. Whenever a monologue happens, the pace grinds to a halt. Still, we need them. If you removed every monologue, all we'd have is a poorly animated high school murder mystery with lots of awkward pauses and angsty teens. Studio Bridge struggled to adapt the inner monologues. The entire scene freezes in place, like a PowerPoint presentation. The director awkwardly framed all of these shots; you can see where the text box would be. It felt like I was watching actors read pages from the manga rather than an actual anime.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                While watching Talentless Nana, it's obvious the writer expects us to be idiots. He used heavy-handed monologues to describe things we could figure out through simple observations. We're not babbling babies. Don't spoon-feed us obvious information. Over explaining simple things doesn't make them intelligent. Nana's plans to murder her classmates are so logically flawed; it seems like the author assumed we wouldn't notice his lazy writing. There's no fear that Nana is in danger because the writer made sure everything would work in her favor. If she's attacked and pushed onto the ground, she'll find a weapon on the floor. Her plans rely entirely on her classmates' mental deficiencies. Everything could fall apart if just one of them had a brain cell rattling around in their empty heads.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I want to be clear, don't expect this to be anything like Death Note. That would be like hoping for a beef sirloin only to get a stick of bubble gum. Although this anime has some exciting twists, the plot is directionless, and it's ridiculously unbelievable how Nana gets away with murder. It happens time after time—a new student gets introduced, Nana plots to kill them, then she attempts her murder. Her victims range from smooth brained kids one through ten. They're bullies, creeps, idiots, and unlucky schmucks who had it coming anyway. It's hard to tell if the show wants us to feel bad for the victims because all of them are unlikeable. Inevitably their superpowers become their entire personality. Many of them were just blank-faced nobodies, wandering around the school looking like ghosts.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                None of the students deserve to die. They're just stupid kids, not terrorists like Nana seems to think they are. Nana is far more dangerous than any superpowered student because she hides behind her false identity as a mind reader. After the first kill, you begin to wonder, "Huh, how has no one realized that everyone who gets close to Nana dies?" They're that dumb. I lost my mind when a student discovered a photo of Nana murdering someone, then proceeded not to tell a single person.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I can't stand "thrillers" where all kinds of horrible things happen because all the characters are either too stupid to catch on or too cowardly to do anything about it. The whole "manipulative sociopath" premise only works when the surrounding characters are of believable intelligence. There's not one brain cell between the entire student body. Check out Kyouya in particular. This moron plays the detective role in the show. He has overwhelming evidence that she's evil, but he doesn't stop her. At this point, a reasonable person would take matters into their own hands, yet he chooses not to. His excuse is, "No one will believe me because she's more popular." For some reason, he never realizes he could simply use his superpower to stop her with force.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The anime's saving grace is Nana, who balances charm, mischievousness, and psychotic undercurrents. Her sociopathic "All these kids are devils" persona is cringe-inducing, but it's fun to laugh at her. Towards the end, her black heart softens, making the only emotional scenes in the show. It's fun to see her maniacally outsmart Kyouya, but there's not much to her. I wish she had some development before the final minute of episode 13. Her backstory is super predictable, but at least it explains her motivations. Still, Nana's decision are unbelievably convoluted. She was sent to the island by an anonymous government bureau to kill students who have done nothing wrong.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                We've made it this far, but I still want to know one thing. What exactly does Talentless Nana wish to be? A satire of superhero shounen anime? A black comedy? A cheesy slasher? Death Note for babies? It seems like all of these ideas inspired the writer, yet he couldn't settle on one. As a result, it can't choose which target to aim for, so it hits none.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The commentary on superheroes boils down to a straightforward question, as Nana said, "Anyone who attains superpowers without any efforts will always become arrogant… If we let immature humans with immature psyches have superpowers, would the world survive?" It's a thought-provoking idea, but not in this anime.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Talentless Nana doesn't have the campy slasher thrills I was hoping for, mostly because it'd rather waste time pretending to be profound. In attempting to tell a complex, morally gray story of an ice-cold spy and her ethical compromises, the anime became an awfully complicated story about forgiving a killer who doesn't deserve anyone's sympathy. The people who will say this is well-written have cut the writer a LOT of slack, or simply don't care about its flaws. The cringe levels here are unlimited, and the art quality is almost as bad as the plot. If you want to watch this, do so as a drinking game. Every time you cringe, take a shot. You'll be shit-faced by the end.

               ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***
               <br/>
               <br/>
               My god, not even my first break-up when I was a teenie disappointed me like this anime did. I think that the comparisson is pretty accurate. Desilusion, a bad time, the feeling of “why did I keep on with this, when it was such a waste of time?”, and the consequent response of “I wanted to know how this was going to end, or if this can be saved”. All those things are in common.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Munou na Nana is an anime that began strongly and that had a huge potential but, as you can expect from my rating, this ended up being the
               <span id="review370181" style="display: none;">
                whole opposite. The story takes place in an island for special kids (and I’m not only talking about their abilities) that are supposed to protect the earth from the “enemies of humanity”, where there is a school that is a sort of Boku no Hero Academy. And actually, that’s your first impression. Nanao, the human that it’s called the ‘protagonist’, is a talentless guy in a talents school. Later on, is revealed that Nanao is not talentless as such, but a guy with the talent to nullify the other’s talents. At the same time, while you’re told his story and how he suffers because no one knew his secret ability and everybody bullied him because of that (I’m sure the CIA told him to kept it secret in order not to control the world), the new girl in the class makes her apparition and gets along with him, a cheerful annoying girl whose talent is to read minds. I was yawning the entire episode until I watched the end of it, when the thing got spicy. I was amazed and thought that it was a great idea that I made it through the end of it, because my expectations grew after that exact moment when, in the final minutes, Nanao gets apparently killed by the new girl, Nana, letting you know that she is sent by the government in order to destroy and eliminate every enemy of humanity. The interesting part of it, is that the enemies of humanity are, indeed, the students that are caught up in that island and, of course, that place is not to educate them, but to have them separated from the rest of the world so they could be killed in mysterious ways. Excellent way of cheering up the party with this finale and that revelation, isn’t it?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I waited up for the next episode to release, and I was so excited, but then it declined a little bit. I didn’t lose hope and tried to see the positive out of it, and it kept for the next two episodes. I even wrote and published a preliminary review saying this was going to be great! After the fifth episode, I had to delete it because, at that moment, I didn’t feel any of the positive things I said before.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The plot continues with Nana killing another classmates, breaking that mask of cute girl from time to time to show her real behavior, having dark thoughts and openly expressing her hate for the other students, of course, when she’s alone. Another thing that was revealed previously is that she has no talent. She can’t read minds, she’s just instructed in body language and is careful enough to understand what’s going on in her surrounding. Suddenly, as more classmates keep disappearing, a  solitary cold guy from her class starts to suspects her and they begin an interesting and indirect war, where both of them try to develope the other’s intentions. At that point, I thought it was still good. But as it progresses and she starts killing indiscriminately, you realize how it gets even stupidier with every episode. Every person dies when she’s with them, and every times she excuses hemself with her fake cutie attitude, by saying that they were attacked by an enemy of humanity (what they believe that are monsters). And that’s it, her sacred word is never doubted, so no one suspects her and no one investigates, and I’m not only talking about Nana, but the school itself, everything is so weird, the professors don’t care at all for their students and neven hear them, and the students don’t even suspect a thing. Sometimes there’s even people that almost witnesses the crime and that, if they had two functional neurons making sinapsis, could easily deduce she was the serial killer. Of course, they don’t. I mean, she kills a stupid guy and, when she’s right next to his body, a stupid girl comes in and asks what happened. This stupid guy that was killed had the ability of premonitions and could keep them as photographs. The stupid girl, while examinating his body, finds out a picture of Nana killing Nanao, and she doesn’t even doubt of her. She just asks “Nana, what’s this?”.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                And this foolishness is repeated every episode. Her classmates never do anything except for Kyouya, the only guy that suspects her and follows her anywhere, and everytime tries to accuse her. He demonstrates in the first episodes that he is smart enough to play the game along with her, but suddenly, after ten episodes and actually knowing she tried to kill him, he still thinks that she can read minds and even gets dazed by her manipulations. Amazing. And that point is important because that makes me real mad because of how nonsensically convenient it is. A lot of times she makes huge mistakes in her ‘minds reading’ and ALWAYS puts the same excuse “haha, I’m sorry, I’m tired and I can’t focus”, and everybody says haha that’s ok. Sometimes, she even says things, by deduction, that every person with those acclaimed neurons could realize by themself, and everybody just gets surprised and reasure she can read minds. I’ve seen secondary characters that are shameful, cringey,  ridiculous or naive, but these are all those adjectives together but multiplied by 2000. It gets to a point where the stupidity of those characters and how blind they are  (that, of course, is a plot convenience) is shooking, illogical, and that you, as a viewer, actually wonder if the human being who made this story is trolling you or just thinking you are as braindead as them. After a little time you even feel insulted. Mangaka-sama, I’m not asking you to write those characters with an IQ of 160, nor to make them capable of beating her in that wit game, I’m just asking for them to, at least, suspect her or to lose trust on her. Nevermind, I’m not even asking for that, I’m begging you to give them a brain. Amen.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Another poor thing about this anime is how they abuse of cliffhangers. Cliffhangers are great, are surprising, catches your attention and so, but when you use it A LOT, it looses its taste and you already expect it. Every episode is stupid and you are there, knowing that Nana is going to kill twenty students more and no one will ever notice, and you are already waiting for the cliffhanger. And you already know that the next episode, when the cliffhanger is solved, Nana will end up being free and innocent to everybody. Is not only that they abuse of this resource, but they actually never maintain what happens on that cliffhanger, since in the next episode, everything will return back to normal as if the cliffhanger never existed. Why did they make it for, then? Is obvious that they are doing that because they are desperate. Some episodes were boring and, just when you get something interesting, boom! Cliffhanger. After six episodes, they should already know that people are not falling for that anymore. Oh, yeah, I forgot, they think the audience is incredibly stupid.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                After a bunch of episodes of this one-dimensional pseudo yandere simulator and her mental deficient classmates with no personality, you get to know her past and her real personality. She likes mental games, she adores chess and Shogi, she’s a manga reader and her parents were killed, apparently, by an enemy of humanity that climbed up her window when she escaped from home to go get the last volume of her favourite manga at almost midnight. Relatable. When she knew what happened she felt guilty. Nevertheless, she reveals to her only friend in the academy (The stupidiest of them all, a cutie cringey girl whose voice is annoying and that’s the one that defends Nana to death) that, after all those years, she doesn’t even feel sad about it, she doesn’t feel guilt, nor hate, nor regrets. And when I thought that this could be an interesting detail of this character, she starts to think about that incident all the time. Until then she was a cold ass killer that never thought about her parents, and hastily she can’t stop thinking about it and, even though she said two mintes earlier that she doesn’t feel anything for that, she totally contradicts her statement in order for us to feel empathy for her, or that at least we think for one second and in the last two episodes, that she is not plain and hasn’t a poor writing. A lame resource, but it’s not that I was expecting anything from this show right now.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The rest of the cast… I don’t want to keep defenestrating them since they are poor little humans betrayed by biology itself, who forgot to make a brain for them. Although, I have to make a summary. Kyouya, who I mentioned before, is a guy (with no development at all, of course) who at first hides his talent, but that later demonstrates that his ability is to be inmortal. This is the one who actually had a big potential since he was the only one whose neurons weren’t on a hunger strike at the beginning, but that didn’t last long, because episodes later he started with a nonsensical behavior. The idea was that he wanted to confuse Nana and make her think he trusted her, but it seems that the one that he confuses is, in fact, the viewer. Let’s see: he, at first, suspects her and almost spits that out to her face, and prooves he is not THAT stupid and that he could be at her level. Further on, he starts to make things like trying to be friends with her for no apparent reason. Okay. If we could understand him just by his actions, yes, it’s logical if we are confused (or if we don’t understand his reasons) since we don’t know what he’s planning to do or if it’s all just an acting to keep an eye on her. But no, the anime shows us his thoughts and his reasoning, and that’s where we see that he is actually not planning anything and he is just dumb enough to not realize obvious things. He just behaves like that because of the relief comedy of him not knowing how to make friends and so. And even when he does approaches Nana to investigate her, he gets fooled by her and her “psychic powers”. At the beginning, I thought he was just pretending to be fooled by her, but no, when they show you his thoughts, you really know that he doesn’t have a clue about Nana not having any talent. And is contradictory! By moments he unfolds an entire intelligent deduction, and by moments he is an idiot who doesn’t know where he is standing. Then, what is the point of this? Kyouya is a wasted character who wanted to be a smartass and forgot the first five letters of the word.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The rest of the cast is even lamer. Inukai Michiru is the most adorable and stupid of them all, an hypocrite who swears that wants to help and save all the people she can, but that blindly denies that Nana is the one hurting and killing everybody. If she really wanted to make a good, she would, at least, wonder why Nana is always when the assassination takes place, why Nana never lets her heal nor inspect the victims’ bodies, why Kyouya steady accuses Nana, why she found a pic of Nana killing Nanao, if she was that sacred deer she believes she is? Is ridiculous. However, by the last episodes, we also see Michiru’s past and how she and Nana are becoming besties, using Michiru as the moral trigger that pulls Nana over the threads and makes her wonder if she’s doing a good deed in name of humanity, or if she’s just being used and deceived by the government. Of course, despite she’s a smartass that can cheat an entire bunch of obtuse students, she’s slow enough to question her actioning after twelve episodes and several cold kills, but nevermind. We, the audience, are even slower, we’re not gonna notice that flamsy construction, aren’t we?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                After those that I mentioned, I had a headache, so I’m not gonna extend more on this. The rest of the characters are the same and worse. You got a fire guy that is the enemy of an ice guy, you have the bullies, and so. All of them respectfully adore Nana and follow her anywhere. The persons she killed, died because of their non-base-confidence and because of that adoration for her leader (who was chosen as their leader because ‘why not?’). I mean, how can you be so confident when there is a serial killer in the island where you are trapped, and when every classmate of yours is disappearing? Not even one character is compelling nor act in a logical way, in order to ease the task to Nana and to make her look like a great unbeatable character. It’s like feeling strong when you’re winning an arm-wrestling against a one-handed person. Another plot convenience that insults you in the face.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In terms of animation and sound I don’t have complaints, but I don’t have compliments either. Everything is common and nothing I would recall. Some VA are annoying and some characters design are likeable since they are very different from each other. The uniform is nice, too. They also abuse of the resource of the darkened face when Nana is in a hurry, and abuse even more of the red and blue background, like some sort of cheap Death Note. At first that one was interesting though, but when they use it all the time to leave the Nana’s voice-off, it loses its effect, and it’s worse when they try so hard to make Kyouya fit the blue side, as if he could be a real opponent for Nana. Guess what? He’s not.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In conclusion, this is a regular animated show with no praising audiovisual work, with flat, awfully silly and absurd characters that will get to your nerves, with a story that started with a really good premise and that ended up in just a “wannabe” with a lot of ridiculous plot armors and the over-use of repetitive resources that were not used as they should. One undeniable thing is that if we need to pass through twelve episodes to say this is worth it, it is definitely not. A plot twist can be good, but there’s no plot twist THAT good to save a whole disaster as big as Munou na Nana. Normally, I try to make a closure that equals bad and good points, but in this anime there’s nothing I can save, so… Don’t. Don’t watch it. Unless you’re as stupid as the public they are aiming with this show, of course, but that’s up to you.

               Let's discuss a topic people like to bring up: stupid and allegedly stupid decisions by the characters, especially some side characters, and whether this counts as luck, plot armor, or whatever. The answer is nuanced. Much of the alleged stupidity is actually deep ignorance, which is different, and the ignorance has been caused on purpose. It is revealed very early on.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               First, a general point: If you follow the full narrative, it is very clear that people irrationally believing in propaganda and other convenient lies is intentional. It is even clearer if you read the manga.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               "Humans don't believe the truth. They believe people."
               <br/>
               "People believe what they
               <span id="review370184" style="display: none;">
                want to believe and hear what they want to hear."
                <br/>
                <br/>
                It is not a bug; it is a feature. The author is trying to make a point here, and he is not trying to hide it. Call it social commentary if you like. More about that below.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If you abuse existing misinformation and other characters' motives, it isn't really plot armor. It is not as though you need additional coincidences for it, aside from the existence of the misinformation and the motives in the first place. Sure, some of the characters are legitimately too trusting or have issues with their mental health. ...Which can still sometimes be suboptimal writing, but that is different than plot armor. Not to mention, several of the events and beliefs are 1) explained in greater detail later on or 2) setups for future plot points with interesting payoffs. This doesn't apply to nearly everything, but sometimes you should be patient and try to look at the narrative as a whole.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Well, let's go over some points and hope it won't turn into a full essay.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                [Obligatory spoiler alert, though I will try to avoid saying the biggest spoilers outright. There will be many mid-sized spoilers though.]
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                1) Blaming the Enemies of Humanity
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In Among Us and also in Danganronpa, for instance, the players and the characters are immediately told that there are killers among them. That is the premise. Here that is not the case, and there are potential scapegoats, most notably the dreaded "Enemies of Humanity." Original name, I know. (Nice troll, author.)
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Anyway, these aliens conveniently happen to be invisible or be able to influence people's minds, or at least that is what many characters believe. And why is that? Because the belief has been perpetuated by decades of government propaganda, all the way down to their textbooks. Often you don't even need to suggest to them that the Enemies of Humanity are at fault; they will recite their textbooks and general knowledge and come up with the idea by themselves. This is a central part of the premise that was established immediately, and even before the events of the series, most of the characters had assumed that these aliens were already on the island, so of course that is their default explanation for problems. In the absence of strong evidence to the contrary, they will believe the alien option. Imagine a story in which the characters genuinely fight against aliens. If a few of them die, would their first assumption be blaming a human killer? No, that would be the wrong genre. Though usually the aliens are not quite as well hidden.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Is it dumb to believe in government propaganda and conspiracy theories? Sure. It says something about people's poor critical reading skills. But that is only to be expected. Mankind is dumb like that. Look at the conspiracy theories tens of millions of real-life people believe in with far lesser propaganda efforts, not to mention their belief in all kinds of entities without empirical evidence.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Keeping that in mind, they are mostly reasonable in not assuming that there is a grand government conspiracy out to get them. Come on, that can't be real, right? There is seemingly no evidence of it. So if that particular conspiracy happens to be real, they are walking into it blind. Good job with the brainwashing, shady government conspirators. There is a nice quote about it later on. "People believe what they want to believe and hear what they want to hear. ... How would that benefit them?" (I omitted a part there to tone down the spoilers.) Incidentally, the idea of mind-controlling aliens is also a setup for a future plot point. It has some ironic payoff that I don't want to spoil too much.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                2) Suspicious alien attack
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Stabbed by an invisible alien? Suspicious, right? Yes, but if you have been indoctrinated into believing that invisible aliens are a thing, less so. And there was no apparent motive for the self-stabbing anyway, so figuring it out required several logical steps that indoctrinated people would not bother to take. Still, Kyoya rightfully points out that it is suspicious that it retreated after a single attack, and he isn't wrong, but let's think about it for a minute. If the best this alien can do is a relatively weak stab attack, and the building is full of super-powered humans about to rush in, retreating might not be a bad idea. Even if it is invisible, it isn't hard to guess where it is if it tries to stab people. But maybe it would opt to self-sacrifice to take out the mind-reader, probably a big threat. That would have been an interesting argument for Kyoya to make.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                3) Why not reveal everything to the class the moment you learn the truth?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Without evidence? That wouldn't go so well. And they lacked evidence, with the exception of Tsunekichi. (More about that below.) Second, for many of them, it would not have helped them achieve their goals. I am not going to go through each person's motives individually.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                4) Just ask her to read your mind
                <br/>
                <br/>
                It happens multiple times during the series, and there are plausible ways out of them. And there apparently are convenient limitations to her mind-reading ability. Nana states that she cannot reliably focus on specific thoughts or parse very specific pieces of information from them, including particular strings of letters or numbers such as passwords. Also, the presence of many people creates background noise that can cover the target's thoughts.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                And it is not as though the students are constantly badgering each other to show off their powers. Even with a mind-reader it is natural to primarily try to have a normal conversation. Would you really ask them to focus on your thoughts instead of talking? Then they might find out things that you don't want them to, and it would be considered rude regardless.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                5) Precognitive photos
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Tsunekichi had strong empirical reasons to trust the accuracy of the photos. He had tried to defy them before, but it had never worked. What was dumb was not anticipating what was done with the photos, though it was true that the tampered material had not been handed over voluntarily, which made it seem more plausible. The way his character was written, it seems that his fatalism had turned him so passive and uncaring of anything that he could barely be bothered to take any measures to protect himself. He is someone who had given up on actively living his life for the most part. So I guess you can substitute stupidity for mental illness.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                By the way, here is a possible interpretation of how the photos work:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                It seems clear that the predictions made by the photos take into consideration how the characters react to those photos. Tsunekichi was refusing to head to the murder scene before the photos were tampered with, and that happened because of the existence of the initial photos. Nothing that happens to fulfill the photos ever seems to violate normal laws of physics. The conditions just happen to be right for the outcomes.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                So the events had to progress roughly the way they did because otherwise the pictures would not have come true, and they had to come true. The events played out as they did because the characters are who they are. It is not as though we should assume that people have metaphysical free wills. Their actions are predictable, at least by some superpowers that can make normally impossible calculations.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If Tsunekichi was the kind of person who would reveal the information to the class or would figure out that the fake photo was fake, he likely would not have got the photos in the first place because then the existence of the photos likely would have prevented those events, and he only gets photos that come true. He could have got a different set of incriminating photos though. If this is the case, what actually ruined Tsunekichi was his fatalism because that is what lead him to behave as he did.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Tl;dr: It is all about causality and determinism. (Let's not get into a quantum mechanics fight in this context, please.)
                <br/>
                <br/>
                6) Mind-reading the spirits of the deceased
                <br/>
                <br/>
                "But that is not how mind-reading works!"
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Well, how does mind-reading work in real life then? Let alone in this fictional world? Yeah, I thought so. Also, they were already doing necromancy in the same room; speaking to the spirit of the corpse is only a few more steps beyond that. Some talents can be broad and multi-purpose, developing into slightly different directions than what you'd initially expect. This seems especially apparent after reading the manga further. That doesn't mean that the ability can't be too convenient in that particular situation. That applies to many other talents though, including the necromancy that was literally going on in the same room.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                This isn't about tactics, but I did find the irony pretty funny. It is adding insult to injury: first the person gets killed, and then people are pretending to speak on behalf of his spirit.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                7) No autopsy
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Tsunekichi was running around telling everyone about the girlfriend thing, so her being the victim of blackmail, assault, etc. was very plausible, most of which was actually true. If she had killed him, it would have probably been by stabbing or blunt trauma, but there were no signs of those. And in that case, she would have openly admitted to self-defence. (The method of killing was the reason against that option.)
                <br/>
                <br/>
                8) No zombie "autopsy"
                <br/>
                <br/>
                People were crept out by the necromancy and allegedly Tsunekichi's suffering on top of that. The decision comes down to how willing they are to torture Tsunekichi's soul to maybe learn about the Enemies of Humanity. I could see them not caring about him and going through with it anyway, so it is reasonable to argue that it was out of character for some of them. You can call it dumb if you like, or being too kind-hearted. It is not ruthlessly efficient, for sure. Maybe Kyoya would have liked to go through with it anyway, but the others would have dragged him out of the room if necessary.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                9) Letting a captive free in exchange for help
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Letting another character free in exchange for letting them use their talent to "speak" to their loved one beyond the grave. That isn't plot armor though, more like emotionally manipulating people by abusing their romantic feelings and state of mind. First of all, she was not planning to kill her captive at that point anyway, and only decided on that later. Exposing everything to the class wouldn't work because of the lack of evidence. She should have taken more precautions though. Barricading the door, for instance. Though it was plausible, given the state of mind of the person in question. But still, barricade the door. Then they probably would have had to talk their way out of it.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                10) "Barricading" in a shed
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The point of the plan is that it wears the opponent down and makes her easier to find while also lowering the chance of her exposing anything to the class. (Not that she had any evidence, and it would have run contrary to her motive anyway.) The time of sunrise was not a deus ex machina because it is easily predictable. The real problem was whether sunlight would deactivate the zombies. Even though it was very likely that sunlight had some effect, judging by the time of day a particular zombie appeared in school, it was not certain that all zombies are equally affected, and furthermore it was possible that the sunlight worked on the zombies too slowly. If they immediately went on a full assault, maybe there would have been enough time to get something done. There was the threat of a hypothetical trap, but still.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                11) Blindly following the leader
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Yes, it is dumb to blindly follow charismatic leaders, but that is what people do. They follow their Great Leaders and trust their words. Look around and read the news. People are actually pretty dumb in that sense.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                12) Not seeing through facades in general
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Yes, it is dumb to let yourself be too easily influenced by a nice smile, kind demeanor, and convenient words. People are dumb like that. Well, I suppose realism isn't everything in fiction though. Narratively, many of the scenes are supposed to be about emotional manipulation instead of foolproof game-theoretical solutions. And you don't really see the latter pretty much anywhere in fiction; you pretty much only get impossible predictions and unlikely coincidences, with a few exceptions. There is of course room for improvement in the manipulation department too, though it was still very amusing to see.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                13) Too often near the victims
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Well, three times as far as most characters think. Still, it creates more suspicion, as mentioned several times and especially addressed during the events of episodes 4 and 8. Not to mention that being the leader puts her in contact with more people, which makes her a likely witness. This was stated multiple times.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                14) Michiru is gullible and trusts her friends too much
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Literally canon. Even the narrative openly acknowledges it. It was done on purpose because it is used in a few later plot points. In the case of the incriminating photo, there is also the additional point that based on earlier photos, it seemed that they could indeed be inaccurate. It still should have rung alarm bells though.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                15) Why not call the phone instead of a body search?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Sounds and other alerts can be turned off, you know. It might be worth a shot though because it is not like there is any downside to it, even if the chances of it working are low.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                16) Why don't they simply have the military level the island?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Explained in episode 2. They have to know enough about the abilities first, and even if you ask them first, they won't always be honest. And an all-out assault may be too apparent, and word might get out. It is still an option if all else fails.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                17) Why doesn't the school take the deaths and disapperances more seriously?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Remember what the purpose of the school is. Why would they? The idea of having them stay on the island is addressed a bit more closely later on anyway. And they did halt the classes when the corpses of the victims started showing up.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                18) Why don't they halt the classes the moment some people stop showing up for class?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Then they would never have class because they keep skipping class anyway.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                19) Why don't the students take more action?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The moment victims start appearing, they increasingly go hide in their rooms. Gathering everyone in one place or trying to leave the island would be problematic too. That said, some of them are not barricading in hard enough, and you can see the result. On the other hand, isolating too much can make it easier to be picked off one by one, especially if there really is an alien menace or a third-party killer around. They could set up a system for keeping tabs on each other in some organized way, not that it would be foolproof. If you try to move around in groups, people will be reluctant to do so if they can't trust the other members. This is even more of a problem if there really are mind-controlling aliens who can influence people with weak psyches. Then people really would bunker down in their rooms, whether it is rational or not. Giving Nana some kind of security escort would have been a good idea though.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                20) Just go look for the aliens
                <br/>
                <br/>
                By wandering in the woods in small groups? Or burning down the woods altogether? I suppose they could do so, not that it would help much against invisible aliens. They could also attack spam in a systematic way and see if they manage to land lucky hits. I think barricading in their rooms is the more likely action they would take though.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                21) Should have done more research
                <br/>
                <br/>
                This is a great idea, actually. The schemes would have been more effective if they had done much more research into the characters' abilities beforehand. And they probably should have. The downside is that it gives the enemies more time to organize, as was about to happen, but it probably would have been worth it anyway.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                22) How about not revealing that you are a mind-reader and leaving the talent question open?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Not a terrible idea because several students do that. It comes with its pros and cons though. It makes you appear more suspicious because people will be cautious of your unknown ability. Though mind-reading is already quite powerful in its own way. Not revealing it also removes the chance to tell people the helpful "info" that mind-reading brings. And if mind-reading is only your fallback option, people will be upset that they only learned about it afterwards.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                23) The schemes are too simple
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Simple schemes are actually more effective. Why would you want your schemes to be so complex that you need multiple flowcharts? In real life, you can't predict other people's actions with arbitrary precision. The kinds of schemes that rely on outrageous predictions against astronomical odds will probably fail. Of course, there are many works of fiction (including quite a few anime, manga, light novels, visual novels, etc.) in which characters carry out such predictions and are lauded as geniuses. But they are not actually geniuses because the works do not present the actual means to carry out those predictions. Here the plans are plausible to construct.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Here the narrative at least presents plausible and semi-plausible explanations for the events instead of the usual completely arbitrary impossible predictions and very unlikely coincidences. I would rather take flawed human reasoning than the kind of reasoning that is impossible for anyone except the omniscient. Yes, I prefer characters to be fallible humans than perfect (or "perfect") god-like entities.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                So what is this series actually about? Good and evil. Not "the good heroes vs the evil monsters" kind but the more nuanced kind in which characters sometimes actually think about their moral decisions.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                We get something with visceral malice, dysfunctional conscience, effective dark comedy, heaps of deception and irony, and surprisingly interesting dialogue. How despicable actions can you carry out until your conscience kicks in? Anything and everything, or is there a limit? And what kind of strain will this place on your future interactions with people? If you keep lying repeatedly, how difficult it will be to convince someone when you are actually telling the truth? As a result, the drama is actually dramatic and the comedy is actually funny. The quality of the dialogue is also surprisingly high, especially including the protagonist's inner thoughts. It is written in a witty way, juxtaposing a facade of seemingly simple lines with more analytical, viscerally heavy-hitting dialogue that tramples on the appearances. Meanwhile, the plot is regularly throwing twists at the reader, and some of them can actually be surprising, which is not something that happens all that often.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Now, some people call this series a "Death Note clone" or "Among Us + My Hero Academia," but I actually think it is something else. Those interpretations may have been effective at spreading word of this series and granting convenient titles to videos on Youtube, but they are also somewhat misleading. This series doesn't have to be Death Note or Among Us. It can be its own thing, and it is better that it is its own thing instead of trying to mimic those other options too closely. For instance, I don't think it is trying to be about outrageously complex mind games with characters somehow predicting dozens of moves ahead. It is more about the moral weight of murder, deception, manipulating public opinion, and exploiting people's weaknesses, and all the long-term consequences that come with those actions.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                There is actual moral tension, shifting moral alignments in a relatively believable way, a powerful sense of hatred and malice, dynamic character relationships strained by past deeds, and tons of delicious irony. The character relationships and interactions can be more dynamic than might appear at first. All of this also results in nice dark comedy that goes far beyond the norm. It blends in well with the drama and doesn't feel out of place.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The dark comedy really is very delicious here. I often found myself laughing at the ironic deception, the thinly veiled threats, the outrageous juxtaposition between cheerful and dark thoughts, the dissonance between people's outward behavior and inner thoughts, and the relationships strained by what happened many episodes ago. It hasn't been marked with the comedy tag, but who cares? It fits my sense of humor better than most comedy I've seen in anime, manga, light novels, etc. There is also meta-commentary and subversion of various common tropes. Seemingly generic heroic characters end up as something different, and tropes related to generic main characters are showcased, then brutally subverted.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                A few of the characters eat up the vast majority of focus, development, and the best dialogue. But better a few good characters than none at all. And the characters should often be introduced more organically, longer before their main role is played out.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The voice actors did a great job here, Nana's especially. I also liked many of the facial expressions, the color-coding for inner monologue, and some suitably over-the-top visual choices like non-existent wind indoors for a big mental showdown, complete with dramatic music. The opening and ending songs are catchy, the opening especially, and the lyrics for both are very fitting. By which I mean that they are nightmarish in a personal, knife-in-the-heart kind of way.
