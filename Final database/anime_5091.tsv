However, she wants to know what ""fun"" really is, waiting for someone who could help her understand its true meaning. One day after school, she crosses paths with her classmate Aya Takayashiki, who takes her on a little adventure. Miki discovers wonders she had never seen before, opening a way to change her withdrawn life.  On their way home, Miki and Aya see their class representative Midori Oono entering Saikoro Club, a store specializing in board games.
