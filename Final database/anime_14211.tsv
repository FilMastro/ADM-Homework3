Wo Zhidao	Movie	1	1956-01-01 00:00:00		38			14211	18407	"The little rabbit was playing hiding and seek with its mother, but the mother worried that the little rabbit would meet a wolf. The mother sang a song that described what a wolf looks like, and mimicked a wolf. The little replied, ""I know, I know,"" despite having never seen a wolf before. The story follows the little rabbit encountering other animals and judging them to be a wolf or not by comparing them to the description from the song."		[]	[]	[['He Yumen', ['Director']]]
