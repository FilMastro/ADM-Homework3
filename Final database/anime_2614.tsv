They are told that a vampire used to live in the hotel way back. Someone even died (was found with bite marks on the neck).  Six years ago a girl was found in the cellar with bite marks on her neck, and the villagers killed her. When one of the guests is killed and Miyuki is attacked by a creature with fangs, it would seem like the vampire is still there...
