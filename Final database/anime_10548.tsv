Dounika Naru Hibi	Movie	1	2020-10-23 00:00:00		15061	5.44	3951	10548	4521	Love is love. Someday, the pain of being in love will be an endearing memory. No matter who the feelings are towards, no matter what form it takes, all love and lifestyles have the same value. An omnibus anime tells the stories of “The wedding of an ex”, “a student and a teacher at an all-boys’ school” and “childhood friends whose bodies and hearts change with adolescence.”  (Source: Kotonoha)	['Dounika Naru Hibi']	"['Yagasaki-kun', 'Sawa-sensei', 'Aya-san', 'Ecchan', 'Shin-chan', 'Mika-chan', 'Yuri', ""Shin-chan's Mother"", ""Shin-chan's Father"", 'Tanabe-kun']"	['Yamashita, Seiichirou', 'Sakurai, Takahiro', 'Komatsu, Mikako', 'Hanazawa, Kana', 'Kido, Ibuki', 'Ishihara, Kaori', 'Hayami, Saori', 'Shiraishi, Ryouko', 'Amasaki, Kouhei', 'Shimazaki, Nobunaga']	[['Satou Takuya', ['Director', 'Screenplay']], ['Aritomi Kouji', ['Episode Director']], ['CreepHyp', ['Theme Song Performance', 'Music']], ['Shimura Takako', ['Original Creator']]]
