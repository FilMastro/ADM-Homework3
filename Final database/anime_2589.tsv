Ajin Part 3: Shougeki	Movie	1	2016-09-23 00:00:00		22326	7.26	4197	2589	3815	For high schooler Kei—and for at least forty-six others—immortality comes as the nastiest surprise ever.  Sadly for Kei, such a feat doesn't make him a superhero. In the eyes of both the general public and governments, he's a rare specimen who needs to be hunted down and handed over to scientists to be experimented on for life—a demi-human who must die a thousand deaths for the benefit of humanity.
