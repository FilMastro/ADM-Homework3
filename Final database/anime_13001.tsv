Running Man	TV	48	2017-07-29 00:00:00	2018-10-12 00:00:00	136			13001	17255	The Soul Tree, the great source of our race.  But for its ultimate power and by those whose minds were blinded by it, it also became the catastrophic cause that had brought never-ending wars between the tribes. Tortured by the agonies of the wars, the leaders of the tribes finally came to a peace agreement that they would instead open a competition. Players, equipped with special watches and shields, compete against each other as winnerâ€™s tribe would be awarded with Materion, the sacred fruit of the Soul Tree.  These brave players, who throw themselves in this fierce fight, we call them the Runningman.  (Source: Official YouTube Channel)		[]	[]
