Yume Miru Koneko	Music	1	1983-08-01 00:00:00		153			14543	16996	"A music video about a cat named Yume (which also means ""dream"" in Japanese). The song itself parodies the songs Der Flohwalzer (in Japan named as Neko Fun Jatta / I Stepped on a Cat) and Beautiful Dreamer (Yumemiru Hito) depending on whether or not ""Yume"" is being seen as a real cat or as a metaphorical dream or as a dream Yume the cat is having.  The music video was aired for 1 month before becoming lost media. In 2016 the Minna no Uta Hakkutsu Project (Minna no Uta Excavation Project) was able to find discover a copy and the music video was saved and re-aired once again after 34 years."		[]	[]
