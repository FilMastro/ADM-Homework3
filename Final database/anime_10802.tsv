The three short films are:  ""Plastic Gun Man"" - a 3D Western spoof ""World Meccano Triangle"" - a music video reminiscent of '90s era screensavers ""Haiirogaoka no Soridaijin"" (translated as ""Prime Minister of Gray Hill"") - an anime-style animated video parody of Akira Mochizuki's famous 1977 manga, Yuuhi ga Oka no Souri Daijin"		[]	[]	[['Taki Pierre', ['Music']]]
