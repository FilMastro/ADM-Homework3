Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Movie: Orion no Ya	Movie	1	2019-02-15 00:00:00		169285	7.44	79662	1822	1045	"Continuing his adventure to get stronger in order to traverse deeper into the ""Dungeon,"" Bell Cranel wanders the Orario city streets with his friends and the goddess Hestia. That evening, the city is filled with stalls and games as it celebrates the Holy Moon Festival.  Hermes, a god, hosts one such activity where participants are asked to pull a spear embedded in a crystal boulder; those who succeed will receive a special gift: a trip around the world and a divine blessing from the gods! Bell and his merry group challenge one another to claim the prize. But behind the facade of an innocent party game lies a preface for a daring quest ahead.
