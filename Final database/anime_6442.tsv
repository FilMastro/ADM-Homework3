But now all that seems like a distant memory. He has become fat, lazy, unemployed, and altogether unlovable. In the real world, people are grossed out by him. He has never had a girlfriend and he spends his late nights fantasizing about women whose pictures he leers at on the internet. His own life appalls him, but he has one escape – his online life. Gaming has become his everything, and he excels at it.  After another long, lonely night of gaming, he wakes up – and is shocked to find that he has transformed into a woman. Or to be more precise, a woman who looks a lot like those he used to lust after online! Confused, he does not know where to turn – so looks for answers on the net. He encounters a young woman in a chat forum named Sae Mi, who offers him advice. He soon falls for her charms – which makes things complicated to say the least. And things get even more bizarre when he attempts to take revenge on Sang Woo, a school bully who turns out to be Sae Mi’s older brother!
