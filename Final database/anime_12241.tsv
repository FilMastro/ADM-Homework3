They travel to Refrigerator Land (Cutie Land) through the air duct. They fall on egg-rabbit Aromi's flower garden! The animals help to fix and reorganize Aromi's flower garden which was damaged because of them.  They meet sausage-monkey Cocomong and set to learn about friendship, compassion, and responsibility together through playing.
