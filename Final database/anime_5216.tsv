The characters include ""Shirokuma,"" a polar bear who is sensitive to cold; ""Penguin?"" (with a question mark in its name), a penguin who is unsure if it is actually a penguin; ""Tonkatsu,"" a piece of pork cutlet that was left uneaten; ""Neko,"" a shy cat; and ""Tokage,"" who hides his nature as one of the last dinosaurs.  The franchise has inspired toys, books, stationery material, video games--and now a feature film.
