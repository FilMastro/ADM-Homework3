Revbahaf Wang-gug Jaegeon-soelgi	TV	26	2007-05-21 00:00:00	2007-11-26 00:00:00	594			12951	12520	Three people are hiding out in a cabin by the foothills.  Van is the prince from the now-defunct Revbahaf Kingdom, Kona – his hand maiden, and Sian – his philosopher and tutor.  Chased by enemies, these three individuals earn the kindness of Aaron, who feeds them at the cabin.  By helping out with Aaron’s chores, the former royal family learns to live a peaceful life getting by, rather than plotting a revenge on the neighboring country which invaded them. Together they try to rebuild the Kingdom of Revbahaf.   (Source: Manhwa101)		['Prince Van', 'Kona', 'Gossen, Julielle', 'Cyan']	[]
