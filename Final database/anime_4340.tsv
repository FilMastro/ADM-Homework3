Dragon Ball: Ossu! Kaettekita Son Gokuu to Nakama-tachi!!	Special	1	2008-09-21 00:00:00		45779	6.86	26883	4340	2625	Based on an original concept by the original author Akira Toriyama, the story, set shortly after the defeat of Majin Buu, pits Son Gokuu and his friends against a new, powerful enemy.  This special introduces four new characters: Abo and Kado red and blue aliens wearing battle fatigues similar to Frieza's army, one tiny yellow alien, and a young Saiyan child who vaguely resembles Vegeta named Tarble. Though very little about the plot has been revealed, Tarble has arrived on Earth, being pursued by Abo and Kado.  (Source: Wikipedia)	['Dragon Ball: Ossu!
