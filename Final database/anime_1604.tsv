Furiko	Special	1	2012-03-16 00:00:00		17883	7.51	11619	1604	4206	"Furiko, meaning ""pendulum,"" shows the highs and lows of a family of twoâ€”a high schooler, and his future wife, whom he rescues from delinquents. From the brilliant mind of comedian Tekken, comes a heartwarming story of a couple overcoming their differences even as they struggle through life. Not a moment goes by without meaning or expression in these four and a half minutes.  [Written by MAL Rewrite]   In December of 2018, Tekken released an extended cut of film which features new music and adds one-and-a-half minutes of runtime."
