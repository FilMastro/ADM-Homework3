In a corner of the black market stood a flimsy soba (buckwheat noodle) eatery.  It was a delicate time just before the closing. A man appeared at the threshold. ""One moongaze (raw egg). With soba."" This was none other than the legendary Fast Food Grifter known as Moongaze Ginji. His relentless scam quietly initiates.   The time changes. In the midst of the first anti Japan-US Security Treaty movement (1960), the streets rumored about Foxy Croquette O-Gin, a beautiful lady Fast Food Grifter, who disappeared all of a sudden. Wandering the alleys in the years of the economic miracle was Crying Inumaru, the loser. Then came Cold Badger Masa, whose scandalous death made people aware of the presence of Fast Food Grifters within the Japanese society. Beefbowl Ushigoro put an end to a major gyudon (beef and rice bowl) restaurant chain. And it is not possible not to mention Hamburger Tetsu, who shocked the entire fast food industry.

Now their legend revives, strong as ever...  (Source: Production I.G.)"
