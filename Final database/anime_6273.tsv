Red	Music	1	2016-11-03 00:00:00		3033	6.47	1192	6273	8362	Red is the opening theme for Kagerou Daze: In a Day's performed by GOUACHE. The music video was released on November 3, 2016 on IA Project's official YouTube channel and advertises the film's release at the end. It was also included on the DVD/BD release of Kagerou Daze: In a Day's but lacks the advertisement. The body of the music video is a mash up of the whole franchise, ideally giving the viewer a refresher before the film's release the next day.
