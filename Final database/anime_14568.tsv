Yuuki Aru Hotaru to Tobe Nai Hotaru	OVA	1	1990-01-01 00:00:00		148			14568	17108	"It is a summer night. From the ""firefly inn"" on the banks of the stream, as the grown fireflies danced, they flew to the night sky one after another.  But only one remains still. It could not fly because the wings were deformed at birth.  Fellow fireflies narrowed their wisdom and succeeded in having it climb up the branches of the willow. The view from the top of a tall tree, it was lovely. But, there was danger waiting.  A good older sister and brother came to pick fireflies and tried to catch the disabled firefly. ""Dangerous!"" Having a firefly that can not move to save itself, a brave firefly jumped into the hand of a boy as a self-sacrifice.  But, they were kind-hearted children. They came to get fireflies for their sister who was unable to walk because of a lame foot. In the room where the light was turned off, fireflies shined brightly. This day, fireflies and the hearts of the children were in unison and spoke with each other.  ""Fireflies, come and see me again"" said the little disabled sister. From the children's window, they saw the hordes of fireflies that came lit up shining like an aurora."	['Pipi Tobenai Hotaru', 'Tobenai Hotaru']	[]	[]
