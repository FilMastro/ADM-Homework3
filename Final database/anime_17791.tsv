One of the biggest reasons for their success onstage would be their manager, Ayaka's older brother, despite his perverted nature.   On the day before their next concert, he informs the girls that he might not be able to attend, causing them to feel very anxious. In the girls' desperate effort to find him, he turns out to be peeping at their every action. With one hour left before their performance, he helps them in ""calming their nerves”.
