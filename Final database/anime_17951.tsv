His investigation reveals the names of three high school girlsâ€”Ayano Yukawa, a gravure model; Misuzu Inami, a public entertainment actress; and Rina Tsubaki, his sister's close friend. His heart filled with vengeance, Ryou kidnaps the three girls and brings them into an abandoned building in the middle of a remote forest. He then proceeds to violate the girls individually in front of a live streaming camera, hoping to make them confess their sins to the world while uncovering the truth behind the destruction of his family.
