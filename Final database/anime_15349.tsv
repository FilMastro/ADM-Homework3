Da Zuiba Dudu	TV	52	2007-01-01 00:00:00	2008-01-01 00:00:00	218			15349	15724	Considered a shanzhai version of Crayon Shin-chan. Dudu is a kindergartner who gets in to lots of trouble while making frequent butt/fart jokes. Most episodes revolve around him and his friends that usually end with a recap half-heartedly attempting a moral lesson to be taught. 		[]	[]
