As he finds out, Kenichi decides to go to a civilized society where his parents live.   Everything Kenichi experiences in the town is a series of surprise and wonder. His family is delighted to see their son alive, but shocked at the fact that he has become wild and different from other children. And now, his new life is about to begin.
