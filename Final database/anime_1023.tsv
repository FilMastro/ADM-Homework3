Rozen Maiden: Ouvert체re	Special	2	2006-12-23 00:00:00	2006-12-24 00:00:00	57178	7.72	32556	1023	2322	As Jun Sakurada fights and lives alongside the Rozen Maidens, special lifelike dolls made to battle each other, he enjoys a rare break in which he is told a story during the events of Rozen Maiden: Tr채umend.   When Jun buys a brooch as a present for Shinku, the fifth doll, she refuses to accept it at any cost. Souseiseki, the fourth doll, then recounts the story of how Shinku and the first doll, Suigintou, first met. This tale tells of the cruel and heartbreaking circumstances surrounding Suigintou's birth, and how the many misunderstandings between her and Shinku shaped their longstanding rivalry fueled by Suigintou's unfettered hate towards Shinku.  The stage is set in Rozen Maiden: Ouvert체re in 19th century London as the story delves into the past of these one-time friends and the secrets that they hold.
