These magical boys are here to save the world from the loveless... at least that's what the pink wombat who gives them their magical powers wants them to do.  In Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei-bu Love!, the main characters are the members of the ""Earth Defense Club"" at the Binan High School, though all they really want to do is hang out, goof off, and relax at the nearby Kurotama Bath. One fateful day, though, a pink wombat appears out of nowhere and forces these five high school students to become ""Battle Lovers"" and protect Earth from a trio of villains who are taking orders from a green hedgehog. Over the course of the series, the Battle Lovers will take on a variety of fiends, including the chikuwabu monster, a chopstick phantom, a monster remote control, and plenty more strange enemies!  Will the heirs to the throne of love be able to protect Earth from those who want to destroy love? Or will the Earth Conquest Club fill the world with hate?"	['Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei-bu Love!
