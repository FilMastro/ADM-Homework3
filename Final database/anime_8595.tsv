But Red Pepper and Wasabi—a duo from the superhero league XPICE—aren't going to stand idly by.  Red Pepper's fiery punches deal with the baddies while Wasabi's healing touch cares for the wounded. Things seem to be going well on the surface. Deep down, however, Wasabi can't help but feel like there's more to being a hero.  One faithful day, the emergency alert blares—Red Pepper's in trouble!
