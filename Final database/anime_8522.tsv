Catman	ONA	7	2002-01-01 00:00:00		2461	6.03	880	8522	8903	In a city filled with anthropomorphic cat-people, Catman lives free of rules and boundaries, doing everything he wants, which often collides with the other inhabitants of the city. Catman dares to be bold: itâ€™s made in Flash, which is rarely seen nowadays; there are no spoken dialogue but instead is subbed in Japanese and English and has a original soundtrack made in purpose for the series.
