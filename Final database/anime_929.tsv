Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade	Movie	1	2015-10-09 00:00:00		154651	7.76	87462	929	1154	You can tell witch training is not going swimmingly for the young sorceresses Akko, Lotte, and Sucyâ€”they face expulsion for screwing up one class too many, and their only way out is if they successfully organize their academy's annual parade through a nearby town. But when they stumble upon the momentous discovery that the objective of the parade is to humiliate witches and commemorate their past subjugation, Akko decides it is time for a change: It is time to show the world how fantastic modern witches truly are! However, with the other girls struggling to keep up with Akko's grandiose ambitions, and everything from mischievous boys to slumbering giants getting in their way, maybe pulling it off will require not only all the magical prowess the pupils of Luna Nova Magical Academy can muster, but also a miracle.
