Kakomareta Sekai	ONA	1	1998-01-01 00:00:00		1648	5.44	476	10553	9951	Kakomareta Sekai is a short animation done by Shinkai Makoto using Lightwave 3D. It is inspired by Japanese novelist Murakami Haruki's book 'Sekai no Owari to Hard-Boiled Wonderland' (English title: Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World). The music was done by Tenmon, who's also responsible for the music in Shinkai's 'Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko', 'Hoshi no Koe', and 'Kumo no Mukou, Yakusoku no Basho'.  Only 30 seconds long, this short was originally viewable at Shinkai's website, but has since been taken down due to bandwidth issues. Its chances of getting a proper release are slim, as Shinkai intended it only as practice using 3DCG programs.   (Source: AniDB)		[]	[]	[['Shinkai Makoto', ['Director']], ['Tenmon', ['Music']]]
