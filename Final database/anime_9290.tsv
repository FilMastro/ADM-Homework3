The world has been contaminated by Irousu (mysterious invaders who suddenly appeared), and humans find themselves restricted and contained. Standing boldly against these invaders are ordinary girls everywhere, without a powerful army or even weapons.  The Shinjugamine Girls Academy is a school for these ""Hoshimori"" (Star Guardians) destined to fight the Irousu.
