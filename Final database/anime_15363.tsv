Daisuki tte Imi dayo	Music	1	2019-04-01 00:00:00		142			15363	17087	"A song about people who having trouble reconciling after a fight. Even though they are fuming, they still love each other.   The song also features Chico and Kyoe from Chico-chan ni Shikarareru!, a live-action variety show on NHK's General channel. Chico is a little girl and Kyoe is a crow, both are mascot/costumed characters in the show. The purpose of the show is to answer questions everyone alike might have such as ""why do you shake hands with people when you leave?"" and ""why does the food hotdog have dog in the name if the food isn't made out of the animal dog?"" through anthropology."
