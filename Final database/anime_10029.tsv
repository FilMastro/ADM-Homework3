Mugen Senshi Valis	Special	1	1987-01-01 00:00:00		680	5.61	306	10029	12131	Mugen Senshi Valis is a Japanese platform game series developed by Telenet Japan.  The Valis games (as they were known in America) tell the story of Yuko Asou, a Japanese student of the late 1980s that is bound to protect three different kingdoms - our own land, the land of the Spirits, and Vecanti, the world of dreams, by using a mystical sword called Valis.  This short anime clip was made as TV commercial for the Nintendo Famicom game.
