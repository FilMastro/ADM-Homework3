Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Special: Nekogoroshi-hen	Special	1	2007-08-02 00:00:00		70360	7.17	38729	3035	2031	As a punishment for losing an intense poker game, Keiichi Maebara, Rena Ryuuguu, Mion Sonozaki, Satoko Houjou, and Rika Furude must walk around town dressed in costumes. Wanting to avoid being seen by more people, Keiichi convinces the group to visit Yagouchiâ€”a deserted neighboring village.  Mion's mention of a nearby abandoned quarry spikes the attention of Rena and Keiichi. Still, as she tells them more about the mysterious incidents surrounding the place, they debate whether it would be wise to explore it.
