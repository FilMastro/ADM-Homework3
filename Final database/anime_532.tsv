Now reunited, Cher and Hubb decide to accompany the wolves in hopes of seeing the journey through to its end, while a distraught and confused Quent wanders aimlessly into the wasteland with his mind fixated on revenge.  Meanwhile, Lord Darcia the Third has finally put his plot into motion and pursues Cheza, pitting him against the pack.
