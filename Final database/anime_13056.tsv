Sakura Momoko Gekijou: Coji-Coji	TV	100	1997-10-04 00:00:00	1999-09-25 00:00:00	503			13056	12948	The only thing that concerns Coji Coji is enjoying life and the wonders of nature. Coji Coji’s friends, on the other hand, are a varied bunch of colorful characters whose many idiosyncrasies have a tendency to create turmoil among one another. Coji Coji’s carefree ways and tendency to shirk responsibility are sometimes a source of frustration, but his childlike wisdom has a way of resolving all of their differences.
