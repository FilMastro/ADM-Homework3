Sekaiichi Hatsukoi OVA	OVA	2	2011-03-22 00:00:00	2011-09-27 00:00:00	63982	7.91	33733	679	2181	Two OVA episodes featuring additional stories.   Episode 0: Ritsu and Takano used to date back in high school, but broke up due to a misunderstanding. This is that story.   Episode 12.5: Hatori and Chiaki go to visit the latter's family. It's really awkward in many, many ways.
