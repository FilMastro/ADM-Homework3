As a result, a 20-year truce was established. Now, with the deal coming to an end, conflicts are brewing in the ostensible peace. In hatred and suspicion, the three families set up their respective Blood Orders, listing the names of the most important people of the hostile families and swearing to hunt them down. A breathtaking war is about to commence.	['Hua Jianghu: Ling Zhu', 'Hua Jiang Hu: Bu Liang Ren', 'Hua Jiang Hu: Bu Liang Ren II', 'Hua Jianghu: Huan Shi Men Sheng', 'Hua Jianghu: Xia Lan']	[]	[]
