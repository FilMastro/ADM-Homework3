Kodomo no Keijijougaku	ONA	1	2007-10-20 00:00:00		1012	5.63	541	9993	11095	A child whose head is numerals, a child who winds his own face and has it under his arm. What was left is his identity, a child whose eyes are provided by fishes, a child who lies down on the floor and head-butts his identity, a child who cannot say anything because of a zipper across his mouth. He undo the zipper but under it is another zipper... Ecology and philosophy of  children with sadness and humour.  (Source: Yamamura Animation) 		[]	[]	[['Yamamura Koji', ['Director']]]
