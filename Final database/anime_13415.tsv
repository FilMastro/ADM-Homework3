Slippy Dandy	TV	4	1987-08-06 00:00:00	1987-09-03 00:00:00	187			13415	16273	"Farcical thievery in the style of Cat's Eye, as the pretty blonde photographer Audrey pursues the burglar Slippy Dandy, unaware that he is really Steve, the young college boy who worships her from afar. This series of shorts was shown as part of the variety show Midnight Treasure Chamber and made in a deliberately ""American"" style (meaning brashly bright colors and redundant sound effects plastered over the action in the style of the 1960s TV Batman).
