Upon arrival, Sasuke encounters several warlords he could only ever dream of meeting: Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and the famous ""Demon King of the Sixth Heaven"" Oda Nobunaga, who takes him in as a vassal. Introducing several modern concepts to the warlords varying from playing tennis to sending chain letters, Sasuke finds his place in an old but utterly new world.
