Cute, outgoing, and affectionate, Kuroha is the perfect older sister type. She has boys constantly begging at her feet to be with her.

Besides, he already has his sights set on his first loveâ€”school idol and renowned author Shirokusa Kachi.  Suehara believes that he has a chance with Kachi after one fateful meeting, but soon, he finds out that Kachi has a boyfriend!
