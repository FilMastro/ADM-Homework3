But when his girlfriend Aika mysteriously dies, Mahiro disappears, vowing to find the one responsible and make them pay for murdering his beloved sister. Yoshino continues his life as usual and has not heard from Mahiro in a monthâ€”until he is confronted by a strange girl who holds him at gunpoint, and his best friend arrives in the nick of time to save him.  Yoshino learns that Mahiro has enlisted the help of a witch named Hakaze Kusaribe to find Aika's killer and of the existence of an entity known as the ""Tree of Exodus.""
