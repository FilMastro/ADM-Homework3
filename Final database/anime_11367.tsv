Broots	Special	1	1984-01-01 00:00:00		389	5.06	210	11367	13683	"The original six-minute ""pilot"" featured a slightly different version of Might Orbots called Broots (pronounced ""Brutes""). Rob and Ono looked similar to their 'finished' selves, though definitively more late 70s-like. The Orbots, while having the same names as in the finished product, are subtly different, and obviously unfinished. Even their combined form aka ""Super-Broots"" would go through some more developmental evolution before becoming Mighty Orbots.  (Source: Wikipedia)"	['Mighty Orbots']	[]	[]
