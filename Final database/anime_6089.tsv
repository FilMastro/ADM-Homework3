Ani Inako is the sole princess of her country, and in order to eliminate hostility between the three countries, she is sent as Inako's representative to a peace treaty signing in Selenfalen. However, Ani's hopes of a smooth ceremony are shattered when she meets the eccentric princes from her rival countries.
