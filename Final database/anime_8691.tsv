Eun-sil-i	Movie	1	2011-11-04 00:00:00		442	5.99	129	8691	13290	In-hye and Sun-mi visit their hometown, a small and quiet village in the countryside, after a long time only to face unexpected news: their old friend Eun-sil died while giving birth. The town is left in an uproar because of the baby, whose father is unknown, and it is neglected, protected by no one. While In-hye and Sun-mi try to save the baby with the help of Ji-young, their friend who has stayed in town, they find out that Eun-sil, who was mentally retarded, was a plaything of the village. In-hye and Sun-mi are troubled with the rage they feel against the village people and the guilty conscience they feel towards Eun-sil. Although they abandoned Eun-sil in the past, will they be able to protect her baby until the end?  (Source: HanCinema) 		['Mi, San', 'Hye, In', 'Li, Eun Sin', 'Jon, Kun', 'Jon, Chi']	[]
