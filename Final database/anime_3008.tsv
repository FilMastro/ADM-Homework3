Tenchi Muyou! GXP	TV	26	2002-04-02 00:00:00	2002-09-25 00:00:00	27669	7.17	12780	3009	3431	From crashing his bike to falling in lakes, Seina Yamada just cannot shake the bad luck that follows him. But his fortune begins to change when he is forcibly recruited into the Galaxy Police and ends up capturing the most pirates in the force.   Now, Seina is no longer just the unfortunate boy from Earth; he is a man that pirates have come to fear. Despite his reputation, Seina is still the same clumsy guy, but at least he has Amane Kaunaq, a former model, and Kiriko Masaki, his long time friend, to keep him together. With their help, Seina sets out on an adventure in the hopes of becoming a great Galaxy Police Officer.  [Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Shin Tenchi Muyou! Ryououki Gaiden: Tenchi Muyou!
