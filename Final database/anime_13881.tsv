Tokugawa Iemitsu to Edo Bakufu	OVA	1	2004-01-01 00:00:00		163			13881	16720	An educational film about Tokugawa Iemitsu. He was the grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasa (who founded the Tokugawa shogunate and ended the Sengoku era with his victory). Iemitsu is mostly known for his xenophobia and tried to close Japan to the world, this is known as Sakoku. The policies he put into place blocked out Japan for nearly 200 years which eventually caused internal strife and internal war in the Meiji era when Japan opened its borders again only to find it was economically, politically, industrially, scientifically, and culturally behind the rest of the world.
