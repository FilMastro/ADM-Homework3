In the first OVA the main character Tomoya returns from America back to Japan, when he gets in trouble. His first great love - Miyuki - mistakes him for a pervert and the next thing he knows is that he's at the police station. When it turns out that it was only a misunderstanding, Miyuki wants to apologize to Tomoya, but at the same his old and pretty friend Anna is visiting him from America. One misunderstanding follows the other... A complicated, but erotic story takes its turn.
