Chemical elements such as oxygen, carbon, gold, molybdenum, and cobalt disappeared from the earth's crust suddenly. The human population was decreased by 90% in sixty years. Researchers found out that the disappeared elements were drained into a planet ""Nega Earth"", located in another dimension. To save the Earth, a special team called the ""Element Hunters"" is organized. All of the members are under 13 years old, because young and flexible brains are needed to access ""Nega Earth""."
