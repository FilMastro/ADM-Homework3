Hi no Tori 2772: Ai no CosmoZone	Movie	1	1980-03-15 00:00:00		3426	6.58	1360	5707	8043	In the distant future, on a dying Earth, human beings are synthetically produced and raised by artificial intelligence to hold specific roles in society. Among them lives Godo Shingo, a candid young cadet who demonstrates uncommon kindness toward living creatures and robots alike. Although Godo's superiors ridicule him for showing attachment to his nursemaid robot, Olga, he makes quite an impression as a sharpshooter and is entrusted with a special task—to capture the legendary immortal bird Phoenix, which has destroyed countless spaceships.  However, his life changes dramatically after falling in love with Rena, the president's daughter who is also the fiancée of Rock Holmes—the Chief of the Science Department. After the pair fails to elope, they are separated, and Godo is sentenced to prison camp labor. Luckily for him, their companions Olga and Pincho—Rena's alien pet—escape unnoticed and come to his rescue.   Hi no Tori 2772: Ai no CosmoZone follows an engaging adventure in outer space, exploring the idea of selfless love as an unparalleled power.
