Now Sachiko has offered to be Yumi's soeur, her ""sister"" and guide for all her years at the academy. The whole idea has Yumi completely flusteredâ€”after all, they hardly know each other!  The entire campus is abuzz with rumors about the two of them, but Yumi is conflicted over accepting Sachiko's offer. While she admires Sachiko, being her soeur would also mean constantly being at the center of the entire school's attention!
