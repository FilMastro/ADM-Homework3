Tales of the Rays	ONA	2	2017-02-17 00:00:00	2018-01-30 00:00:00	4373	5.99	948	8677	7406	Includes an animated promotional/opening video for the iOS/Android game Tales of the Rays and the main promotional video. Bandai Namco announced it was a sequel to Tales of the Rays and streamed the video on their official YouTube channel.  The game and videos star new characters Ickx Neve and Mileena Weiss along with a cast of returning characters from other Tales of games.  In a nontraditional manner, no new game app will be created, rather the current game app will receive a massive update and discontinue the main story line and start anew (several years later in-story) resetting the game play for all users. The story is said to take a darker tone.  The game's production was announced in 2015 and the official launch is expected some time later this year.
