Wena Wrist	Special	1	2020-01-28 00:00:00		317	5.29	151	10929	14402	"Sony unveiled its new ""wena wrist"" smartwatch's ""kawamori Edition"" with Macross anime director and mechanical designer Shoji Kawamori, and naturally, it comes complete with an anime ad.   The aircraft shown in the video closely evokes the forward-swept-wing YF-19/VF-19 variable fighter designs first seen in Macross Plus and Macross 7, but appears to also draw inspiration from real-life fighter craft, with canards common in European fighters, and an air intake similar to the F-16. The iconic motif of hands in the shape of a fighter also first appeared in Macross Plus.  Kawamori designed the case that will ship alongside the Wena Wrist product. The watch itself is a mechanical design, evoking pilot watch-style elements. The dial's design evokes the attitude indicator/artificial horizon seen on fighter instrument panels, with one side being an open-heart design showing the mechanical movement. The 12:00 position is indicated by a white arrow, common to many pilot watches.   (Source: ANN)"		[]	[]	[['Kawamori Shouji', ['Director']], ['BUMP OF CHICKEN', ['Music']]]
