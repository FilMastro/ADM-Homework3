Cherry and Virgin	Movie	1	2022-01-01 00:00:00		2431				9066	"Cherry and Virgin is a romantic comedy featuring a 32-year-old ""eromanga"" author Ryou and a 28-year-old ""fujoshi'' Ami. Neither character is great at interacting with members of the opposite genderâ€”Ryou is somewhat of an otaku and defenseless against women, and Ami does not have a good impression of 3D men. After a fateful encounter, the story follows the two as they learn to navigate a sea of interpersonal relationships and come to better understand the bitter and sweet aspects of modern relationships.
