We keep reviewing and seeking out the motives of criminals, exploring the subtlest emotions driving them. It’s not to put ourselves in their shoes and sympathize, or even forgive them; it’s not to find some reasons to exculpate their crimes; it’s not to kneel down before the so-called ""complexity of human nature""; nor to introspect social conflicts, much less to alienate ourselves into monsters.  We just want to have a fair trial – for ourselves and for those who still have hope for the world.
