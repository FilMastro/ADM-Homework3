Hacka Doll The Animation	TV	13	2015-10-02 00:00:00	2015-12-25 00:00:00	45067	6.39	15032	6751	2647	Hacka Dolls are AI that scan a person in order to tailor news recommendations and information to their users. These widespread, personalized robots have served many citizens, from government officials to professional sports players.  A severe drop in quality leads to the production of three substandard Hacka Dolls. Due to their personality defects, they are sent to Earth, tasked with advancing humanity in whatever way they can. Whether it be encouraging a fujoshi to sell a doujinshi at Comiket or performing in an idol group, the three dolls will complete any task as long as it abides by their moral compass. Despite their shortcomings, they take their mission very seriously and always try their best to assist everyone with incredible enthusiasm.  [Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Oyobi desu ka!?
