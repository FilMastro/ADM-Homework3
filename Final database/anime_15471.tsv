Doron Coron	Movie	1	2012-01-01 00:00:00		168			15471	16628	"An amusing 3-minute clay animation that Yuuichi Itou (Harbor Tale, Knyacki!) produced for ""The Earth and Children of Tomorrow - Pray for Happiness"" campaign by TVK (Television Kanagawa).  Doron Coron comes to life after a child angel tinkles off a cloud.  This unusual heavenly elixir rains down onto a dark city street and brings to life the titular boy character made of dirt who rolls off to explore the city.  He has a pleasant interaction with a worm, and a not so pleasant interaction with bird excrement, but is cheered by the growth of a plant on his head.  The plant grows and grows and Doron Coron heads to the countryside where he enjoys pleasant interactions with the natural world.   (Source: Nishikata Film Review)"		[]	[]
