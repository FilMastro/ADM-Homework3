Kago Shintarou Anime Sakuhin Shuu	OVA	15	2008-01-01 00:00:00		4717	4.91	1440	11564	7178	In these jokey short films, many of them crudely animated, Kago's sick sense of humor reaches its full heights of absurdity. There's a playful surrealist sensibility to Kago's work, as well as a tendency to revel in the ridiculous, the crude and the disturbing. His work straddles a weird boundary between avant-garde experimentation and low-brow fart jokes—the punchline of one of these films is literally an oozing torrent of shit—although, admittedly, his videos seem to lean a bit more heavily towards the fart jokes than his comics. But hey, who doesn't appreciate a good fart joke once in a while?  (Source: Only the Cinema blog)		['Buddha']	[]	[['Kago Shintarou', ['Creator']]]
