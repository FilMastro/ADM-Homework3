He enters the drama club because his best friend, Wakabayashi asked him to do so, but it turns out the club is on the verge of dissolution.

In the meanwhile, Makoto's schoolmate since junior high - now a student of the other class - Abegawa Nozomi seeks to launch a so called ""study club"". Both clubs get into a pinch, as the student council won't finance their activity for this year, and even the day of a performance is approaching... Can the drama club survive this crisis?
