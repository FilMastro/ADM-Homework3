Death… hope… freedom… A girl was born with the secret to the end. She... is not allowed to live freely. ""Freedom"" was just a word she yearns for. She lived in a closed and narrow world. Her life is chosen by someone. Therefore, she thought, if the God only gives me a scenario with no freedom, I want to share the ""death"" with you, not that ""someone."" I want to give the half of destiny to her, even if I have to share the ""death"" with her.
