Kaijuu ga Yattekuru	Music	1	1967-10-04 00:00:00		163			16515	16782	"Animals at a zoo hear that a kaijuu is coming. Like a game of ""Telephone"" they hear bits and pieces of what the kaijuu looks like which gets distorted each time the information is passed on. In the end, it was just a normal zoo animal joining the exhibits."		[]	[]	[['Kuri Yoji', ['Animation Director']]]
