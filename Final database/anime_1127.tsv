However, her world is turned upside down when she is called into the headmistress' office and informed of news that no child wants to hear: her father has passed away.   Now an orphan, Sarah is stripped of her status as a student and is forced to work in the boarding school as a maid in order to support herself. To make matters worse, her once friendly peers suddenly turn against her upon hearing about her fall from wealth.
