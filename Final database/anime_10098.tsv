Rinkaku	Music	1	2012-10-16 00:00:00		1412	5.59	780	10098	10306	"Following the release of their 8th album ""DUM SPIRO SPERO,"" Japanese rock band Dir en Grey went into hiatus following a vigorous touring schedule in Japan and abroad, a year and a half later returning with their single ""RINKAKU"" released on December 19th, 2012.  Once again animator Keita Kurosaka was enlisted to create a hand drawn music video, that in many regards is much less shocking and grotesque than the band's previous collaboration with Kurosaka, the infamous ""Agitated Screams of Maggots"" music video.
